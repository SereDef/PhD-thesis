## Early-life stress (ELS)
When my mother was pregnant with me, my older brother died of a congenital condition. I never met the little guy, never experienced any grief myself. Yet, for the longest time I thought that, somehow, his death had cast a sort of shadow over the rest of my life. And I was not the only one. The idea that exposure to stressful experiences during *"critical" periods* of early development wields profound, long-term impact on emotional and physiological regulation, is nothing new. Sigmund Freud, among others, made quite a sensational career out of it, and - perhaps partly because of the success of psychoanalytic theories - the scientific literature on the topic today is almost intimidatingly vast.

So vast in fact, that it requires a pinch of terminology clarification, before we can dive into it. For the remainder of this book, I will use the term "Early-Life Stress" (ELS) to refer to a host of adverse life events or conditions, that are experienced during the first years of life, e.g., in childhood, and, even earlier, during gestation. These experiences (sometimes also referred to as “childhood trauma”, “maltreatment”, “early adversity”, or “adverse childhood experiences”) encompass a wide range of stressors, including neglect and abuse, bereavement, bullying but also poverty, material deprivation and/or parental psychopathology [@Heim2020].

ELS is a widely studied concept, partly because it is surprisingly common: more than half the population experiences at least one form of ELS before the age of 18 years [@Madigan2024]. But more importantly, ELS is one of strongest, most consistent predictors of mental health problems later in life, particularly depression [@Li2016; @LeMoult2020; @Li2023].

Systematic scientific investigations into ELS and its consequences, really gained momentum in the late 90s, when large-scale epidemiological studies, began to also highlight a relationship between ELS and an increased risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality (e.g. [@Felitti1998]). This line of evidence also proved very robust over time, so ELS is now a well-recognised risk factor for cardio-metabolic health problems, including obesity [@Wiss2020; @Danese2014], type 2 diabetes [@Zhu2022], hypertension and cardio-vascular disease [@Jakubowski2018; @Jacquet-Smailovic2022].

## Mental & physical health: a comorbidity paradigm

Interestingly, parallel to this growing interest in the effects of stress and psychosocial factors on physical health, the early 2000s also witnessed a surge of epidemiological studies uncovering the relationship between depression and cardio-metabolic health problems[@Penninx2001; @VanderKooy2007; @Luppino2010]. Historically, these two conditions had been largely investigated as separate entities, each with distinct risk factors and treatment approaches. Their connection was not entirely overlooked (see for example early theoretical work by @Engel1977), but it remained peripheral to mainstream medical research until relatively recently.

As more evidence accumulated that depression and cardio-metabolic conditions tend to co-occur [@Anwar2018; @Blasco2020; @Gutiérrez-Rojas2020], several potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observed comorbidity [@Milaneschi2019]. One possibility is that these conditions share common risk factors, such as genetic liability for instance, but also ELS exposure, as discussed above and supported by a recent large scale meta-analysis [@Souama2023]. It is also possible that experiencing depression may directly increase the risk of developing cardio-metabolic health problems later in life. For example, in two meta-analyses based on longitudinal data, depression was found to be risk factor for obesity and diabetes [@Mannan2016; @Ditmars2022]. Other longitudinal meta-analyses however, have also shown, in turn, that poor cardio-metabolic health was a robust predictor of later depression [@Zhou2024], supporting the hypothesis of a bi-directional relationship.

## An integrative approach

So far, we have described a triangle of relationships - i.e., between *a)* ELS and mental health, *b)* ELS and cardio-metabolic health, and *c)* mental and cardio-metabolic health (@fig-thesis-summary A), which received considerable attention in the medical literature. This isn't surprising. Depression and cardio-metabolic conditions are among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, shaping an enormous public health burden which is largely preventable [@Anwar2018]. ELS is a promising shared risk factor, which can be measured years - and even decades - before clinical symptoms emerge, making it an ideal candidate for informing early detection and improving the integrated prevention of psycho-physical health problems.

However, there are some key considerations to note, before these findings could be effectively translated into clinical practice. 

Firstly, as briefly hinted above, the literature is very heterogenous in its definition of ELS. While many studies focus on specific types of adversity, particularly childhood neglect and abuse. Most studies have focused on neglect, physical and sexual abuse, though it is much more complicated construct than that. Only a few used cumulative scores.

Secondly, most studies assess these relationships in isolation, or as part of much broader constructs...

Lastly, the overwhelming majority of existing studies has been conducted in adult or aging populations, which warrants two important implications. The first one is technical: the proposed relationship between ELS and adult psycho-physical health relies heavily on retrospective reports of ELS exposure, which may have introduced recall bias, unrealistically inflating these association estimates. The second one is practical: if it was indeed true that ELS wields a causal (i.e., prospective) effect on later psycho-physical health problems, when does this effect begin? How early can ELS be used to identify people at higher risk for depression and/or cardio-metabolic disease?
Similarly, studies investigating bidirectional relationships between mental and physical health, even though longitudinal, are largely limited to adulthood though both depression and cardio-metabolic health problems find their roots very early in development.

## This thesis: one step back in time

This thesis (@fig-thesis-summary B) aims to address some of these limitations and open questions. We will focus on adolescence, a critical developmental period, when many mental health problems first emerge, and early signs of cardio-metabolic dysregulation begin to manifest. By examining these relationships prospectively, this thesis seeks to provide a clearer understanding of how ELS impacts psycho-physical health during this formative stage of life.

Part 1 of this thesis will focus on characterising the prospective relationship between ELS and psycho-physical health in adolescence. @sec-chapter1 examines the relationship between prenatal (i.e. in utero) and postnatal (i.e. childhood) cumulative exposure to ELS and adolescent internalizing symptoms, adiposity, and their comorbity. @sec-chapter2 further explores wether behavioral factors such as sleep, diet and pysical activity may moderate the associations established in Chapter 1. @sec-chapter3 and @sec-chapter4 take a closer look a the potential "biological scars" that ELS may leave behind already on the brain and the heart respectively. 

Part 2 of the thesis, follows up on the reciprocal relationship between mental and physical health across childhood and adolscence. In particular @sec-chapter5 examins the longitudinal co-development of depressive symptoms and several markers of cardio-metabolic health from childhood to early adulthood. **Chapter TBD** finally looks at the relationship between the developing brain and arterial health as an early marker of cardio-vascular health.
