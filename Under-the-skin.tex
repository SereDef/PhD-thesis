Dear reader,

Let me begin this book the only way that feels right: with a little note
of honesty. Writing this was hard, much harder than I anticipated.
Perhaps out of pride, or because of this irresistible greed I feel to
dissect and point out limitations - that, I am told, makes for a good
scientist as much as a horrible friend - I kept wondering whether any of
this would be worth your time.

I guess 5-years-ago me hoped, at this point, they could promise you
sensational scientific breakthroughs and game-changing statistical
tricks ahead. Well, it looks like we may both have to settle for a
somewhat less glamourous, but perhaps more truthful, process of
scientific discovery.

So here is a collection of small steps toward understanding, many little
increments of knowledge, a couple of false starts, a few frustratingly
inconclusive results, and a handful of insights (some grim, some
hopeful).

Still here? Didn't think so\ldots{} let's talk about early-life stress,
shall we?

\chapter{General Introduction}\label{sec-chapter1}

\section{Early-life stress (ELS)}\label{early-life-stress-els}

When my mother was pregnant with me, my older brother died of a
congenital condition. I never met the little guy, never experienced any
grief myself. Yet, for the longest time I thought that, somehow, his
death had cast a sort of shadow over the rest of my life. And I was not
the only one. The idea that exposure to stressful experiences during
\emph{``critical'' periods} of early development wields profound,
long-term impact on emotional and physiological regulation, is nothing
new. Sigmund Freud, among others, made quite a sensational career out of
it, and - perhaps partly because of the success of psychoanalytic
theories - the scientific literature on the topic today is almost
intimidatingly vast.

So vast in fact, that it requires a pinch of terminology clarification,
before we can dive into it. For the remainder of this book, I will use
the term ``Early-Life Stress'' (ELS) to refer to a host of adverse life
events or conditions, that are experienced during the first years of
life, e.g., in childhood, and, even earlier, during gestation. These
experiences (sometimes also referred to as ``childhood trauma'',
``maltreatment'', ``early adversity'', or ``adverse childhood
experiences'') encompass a wide range of stressors, including neglect
and abuse, bereavement, bullying but also poverty, material deprivation
and/or parental psychopathology (Heim, 2020).

ELS is a widely studied concept, partly because it is surprisingly
common: more than half the population experiences at least one form of
ELS before the age of 18 years (Madigan et al., 2024). But more
importantly, ELS is one of strongest, most consistent predictors of
mental health problems later in life, particularly depression (LeMoult
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2016; Li et al., 2023).

Systematic scientific investigations into ELS and its consequences,
really gained momentum in the late 90s, when large-scale epidemiological
studies, began to also highlight a relationship between ELS and an
increased risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality (e.g.
(Felitti et al., 1998)). This line of evidence also proved very robust
over time, so ELS is now a well-recognised risk factor for
cardio-metabolic health problems, including obesity (Danese \& Tan,
2014; Wiss \& Brewerton, 2020), type 2 diabetes (Zhu et al., 2022),
hypertension and cardio-vascular disease (Jacquet-Smailovic et al.,
2022; Jakubowski et al., 2018).

\section{Mental \& physical health: a comorbidity
paradigm}\label{mental-physical-health-a-comorbidity-paradigm}

Interestingly, parallel to this growing interest in the effects of
stress and psychosocial factors on physical health, the early 2000s also
witnessed a surge of epidemiological studies uncovering the relationship
between depression and cardio-metabolic health problems(Luppino et al.,
2010; Penninx et al., 2001; Van der Kooy et al., 2007). Historically,
these two conditions had been largely investigated as separate entities,
each with distinct risk factors and treatment approaches. Their
connection was not entirely overlooked (see for example early
theoretical work by Engel (1977)), but it remained peripheral to
mainstream medical research until relatively recently.

As more evidence accumulated that depression and cardio-metabolic
conditions tend to co-occur (Anwar et al., 2018; Blasco et al., 2020;
Gutiérrez-Rojas et al., 2020), several potential mechanisms have been
proposed to explain this observed comorbidity (Milaneschi et al., 2019).
One possibility is that these conditions share common risk factors, such
as genetic liability for instance, but also ELS exposure, as discussed
above and supported by a recent large scale meta-analysis (Souama et
al., 2023). It is also possible that experiencing depression may
directly increase the risk of developing cardio-metabolic health
problems later in life. For example, in two meta-analyses based on
longitudinal data, depression was found to be risk factor for obesity
and diabetes (Ditmars et al., 2022; Mannan et al., 2016). Other
longitudinal meta-analyses however, have also shown, in turn, that poor
cardio-metabolic health was a robust predictor of later depression (Zhou
et al., 2024), supporting the hypothesis of a bi-directional
relationship.

\section{ELS and psycho-physical health: towards an integrated
approach}\label{els-and-psycho-physical-health-towards-an-integrated-approach}

So far, we have described a triangle of relationships - i.e., between
\emph{a)} ELS and mental health, \emph{b)} ELS and cardio-metabolic
health, and \emph{c)} mental and cardio-metabolic health
(Figure~\ref{fig-thesis-summary} A), which received considerable
attention in the medical literature. This isn't surprising. Depression
and cardio-metabolic conditions are among the leading causes of death
and disability worldwide, shaping an enormous public health burden which
is largely preventable (Anwar et al., 2018). ELS is a promising shared
risk factor, which can be measured years - and even decades - before
clinical symptoms emerge, making it an ideal candidate for informing
early detection and improving the integrated prevention of
psycho-physical health problems.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-thesis-summary}\textbf{Schematic representation of
this thesis, in the context of previous literature}\newline(A) A
schematic summary of the existing evidence, on the relationships under
study. This is largely based on adult outcomes and retrospectively
measured ELS exposure (indicated by the dashed line).\newline(B) A
Schematic summary of the relationships examined in this thesis.}

\end{figure}%

However, there are three key challenges that need to be addressed,
before these findings could be effectively translated into clinical
practice.

Firstly, as briefly noted above, the literature is very heterogenous in
its definition of ELS, with many studies focusing on specific types of
adversity (e.g., childhood neglect and abuse). However, there is
convincing evidence that exposure to multiple stressors - i.e.,
different sources of stress, as well as repeated or continued exposure
over time - has much worse consequences for psycho-physical health,
compared to individual stressors (Evans et al., 2013; Hughes et al.,
2017). This underscores the importance of identifying of children who
face multiple forms of ELS, as they may represent a particularly
vulnerable population, who should be prioritized in intervention
programs.

Secondly, existing studies typically only address one ``side'' of this
triad of relationships. For instance, while ELS has been linked to both
depression and obesity independently, its role in determining their
co-occurrence remains heavily understudied. Consequently, it is hard to
establish the relative importance of ELS as a risk factor for each
disorder in isolation vs.~their comorbidity, which poses an obstacle to
the development of integrated prevention and intervention (Anwar et al.,
2018).

Lastly, the overwhelming majority of studies investigating either the
role of ELS, or the(bidirectional) relationships between mental and
physical health, has been conducted in adult or aging populations.

On one hand, this brings about important measurement issues. Namely, the
proposed relationship between ELS and adult psycho-physical health
relies heavily on retrospective reports of ELS exposure, which may have
introduced recall bias, unrealistically inflating the association
estimates reported by the literature (Reuben et al., 2016).

On the other hand, both depression and cardio-metabolic health problems
very often find their onset well before adulthood. A growing number of
adolescents, for instance, experience depressive symptoms before the age
of 20 years (Keeley, 2021; Patalay \& Gage, 2019). Concurrently, while
cardio-metabolic endpoints such as myocardial infarction and diabetes
are traditionally associated with later life stages, their prodromal
forms, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, manifest more
and more frequently between childhood and adolescence (NCD-RisC, 2017;
WHO, 2022). Intervening during this early developmental window could be
crucial to mitigate the progression of such prodromal psycho-physical
symptoms into chronic mental and physical health conditions later in
life.

In this context, prospective cohort studies that begin at conception and
capture a broader spectrum of ELS exposures and psycho-physical
symptoms, are essential to map causal pathways and inform on optimal
intervention windows.

\section{This thesis: one step back in
time}\label{this-thesis-one-step-back-in-time}

This thesis (Figure~\ref{fig-thesis-summary} B) aims to address some of
these limitations and open questions.

\textbf{Part 1} will focus on characterizing the prospective
relationship between ELS and adolescent psycho-physical health. First,
in Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter2}, I quantify the relationship between ELS
exposure during two key developmental periods (i.e.~pregnancy and
childhood) and adolescent \emph{a)} internalizing symptoms, \emph{b)}
adiposity, and \emph{c)} their comorbidity. Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter3}
further explores wether three common lifestyle factors (i.e., physical
activity, sleep duration, and diet quality) may moderate the
associations identified in Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter2}. I will then take
a closer look at the potential ``biological scars'' that pre- and
postnatal ELS exposure may leave behind on children's brains
(Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter4}) and on their hearts
(Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter5}).

In \textbf{Part 2} I will then characterize the reciprocal relationship
between mental and cardio-metabolic health across childhood and
adolescence. Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter6} examines the longitudinal
co-development of depressive symptoms and several markers of
cardio-metabolic health from childhood to early adulthood. In
Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter7}, I assess the relationship between early
cardio-vascular health markers (i.e., arterial health and blood
pressure) and the developing brain.

\markright{Abstract}

\ul{Objective}: Depression and obesity are two highly prevalent and
often comorbid conditions. Exposure to early-life stress (ELS) has been
associated with both depression and obesity in adulthood, as well as
their preclinical manifestations during development. However, it remains
unclear whether: \emph{(i)} associations differ depending on the timing
of stress exposure (prenatal vs postnatal) and \emph{(ii)} ELS is a
shared risk factor underlying the comorbidity between the two
conditions.

\ul{Method}: Leveraging data from two large population-based birth
cohorts (ALSPAC: n=8428 (52\% male participants); Generation R: n=4268
(48\% male participants)), we constructed comprehensive cumulative
measures of prenatal (in utero) and postnatal (from birth to 10 years)
ELS. At age 13.5 years we assessed: a) internalizing symptoms (using
maternal reports); b) fat mass percentage (using dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry); c) their comorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of
high internalizing and high adiposity.

\ul{Results}: Both prenatal (\emph{total effect} {[}95\%CI{]} = 0.20
{[}0.16; 0.22{]}) and postnatal stress (\(\beta\) {[}95\%CI{]} = 0.22
{[}0.17; 0.25{]}) were associated with higher internalizing symptoms,
with evidence of a more prominent role of postnatal stress. A weaker
association (primarily driven by prenatal stress) was observed between
stress and adiposity (prenatal: 0.07 {[}0.05; 0.09{]}; postnatal: 0.04
{[}0.01; 0.07{]}). Both pre- (OR {[}95\%CI{]} = 1.70 {[}1.47; 1.97{]})
and postnatal stress (1.87 {[}1.61; 2.17{]}) were associated with an
increased risk of developing comorbidity.

\ul{Conclusion}: We found evidence of \emph{(i)} timing and \emph{(ii)}
shared causal effects of ELS on psycho-cardiometabolic health in
adolescence, but future research is warranted to clarify how these
associations may unfold over time.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The co-occurrence of depression and obesity is a rising public health
concern, affecting increasingly younger populations (Sutaria et al.,
2019). Individuals with obesity are \textasciitilde30-40\% more likely
to develop depression compared to the general population
(Pereira-Miranda et al., 2017). In turn, depression also increases the
risk of developing obesity (Pratt \& Brody, 2014) and related
cardiometabolic disease (Hare et al., 2014). While the relationship
between depression and adiposity is likely multifactorial and complex,
the observed comorbidity between the two may be partially explained by
shared environmental risk factors, such as exposure to stressful
experiences early in life (Shonkoff et al., 2012).

Indeed, early-life stress (ELS) is a well-established risk factor for
both adult depression (Li et al., 2016) and obesity (Danese \& Tan,
2014). In children and adolescents, ELS exposure in utero and
postnatally (e.g., adverse childhood experiences) have been separately
linked to preclinical manifestations of depression, such as
internalizing problems (Cecil et al., 2017; Van den Bergh et al., 2020),
and several adiposity measures (Burgueño et al., 2020; Elsenburg et al.,
2017).

Identifying critical exposure windows (i.e., prenatal vs postnatal) can
provide important insights into the best timing for prevention and
intervention programs, and shed light on the mechanisms through which
stress may lead to disease (Hartman \& Belsky, 2018). However, very few
studies prospectively investigated the influence of both pre- and
postnatal stress on these outcomes, and, because stress shows continuity
over time, it is unclear whether \emph{(a)} previously reported
postnatal associations may partly reflect preceding prenatal exposures
(i.e., prenatal ELS as confounder), and \emph{(b)} observed prenatal
associations may be partly mediated by postnatal ELS (i.e., postnatal
ELS as mediator).

Further, existing studies have examined ELS associations with
internalizing and adiposity either separately (Slopen et al., 2014) or
as part of a broader ``multisystemic'' disease constructs (Juster et
al., 2016). It remains unknown whether ELS represents a shared risk
factor for comorbid emotional problems and adiposity. Establishing such
association is important, since protocols for the integrated detection
and management of these health conditions are lacking (Anwar et al.,
2018), and differential patterns of ELS exposure may help identify
subgroups of adolescents at higher risk for comorbidity.

To address these gaps, we leveraged longitudinal data from two
population-based prospective birth cohorts to examine \emph{(i)} how
pre- and postnatal ELS (up to age 10 years) associate to internalizing
symptoms and adiposity in early adolescence (i.e., at age 13 years),
taking into account potential confounding and mediation effects; and
\emph{(ii)} whether ELS accounts for comorbidity between internalizing
problems and excess adiposity, above its contribution to each health
outcome individually. Based on previous findings, we expect that both
pre- and postnatal ELS prospectively associate with internalizing
symptoms and adiposity, as well as their comorbidity. No a priori
hypotheses were specified regarding the relative importance of pre- vs
postnatal ELS.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

This manuscript follows STROBE guidelines (Elm et al., 2008).

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Our sample was drawn from two population-based cohorts: the Generation R
Study (GenR), including 9,778 pregnant women in Rotterdam (the
Netherlands), who delivered their babies between April 2002 and January
2006 (Kooijman et al., 2016); and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children (ALSPAC) involving 14,541 pregnant women in Avon (UK), with
delivery dates between April 1991 and December 1992 (Boyd et al., 2013;
Fraser et al., 2013). The
\href{http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/}{ALSPAC
website} contains details of all the data that is available through a
fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool.

Response rates at the 13 years follow-up were 64\% in GenR and 61\% in
ALSPAC. Participants with \textgreater{} 50\% missing ELS variables in
the pre- or postnatal period were excluded, as were all twins. In the
case of non-twin siblings, only one was selected (see Figure S1,
available online). The final sample included 4268 (GenR) and 8428
(ALSPAC) children.

\subsubsection{Ethical standards}\label{ethical-standards}

Ethical approval was obtained from the medical ethical committee of
Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam and from the ALSPAC
Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees.
Written informed consent was obtained for all participants and both
studies conform with the World Medical Association Declaration of
Helsinki (2013).

\subsection{Measures}\label{measures}

\subsubsection{Prenatal and postnatal
ELS}\label{prenatal-and-postnatal-els}

The prenatal (i.e., maternal exposure during pregnancy) and postnatal
(i.e.~from birth to 10 years) cumulative ELS scores comprise information
about five stress domains in line with previous literature (Cecil et
al., 2014; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2016): life events (e.g., death of a
parent), contextual risk (e.g., financial difficulties), parental risk
(e.g., parental psychopathology), interpersonal risk (e.g., family
conflicts) and direct victimization (only postnatally, e.g.~maltreatment
or bullying). Note that, consistent with other work using this measure
(Schuurmans et al., 2022), we use the term ``postnatal'' (in contrast to
``prenatal'') to encompass stressors experienced across childhood (i.e.,
until the age of 10 years), rather than immediately following birth. A
detailed description of the ELS scores is provided in online
\textbf{Supplement 1} (see also the score's
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/cumulative-ELS-score}{GitHub
repository} for further details and scripts). Briefly,
\textasciitilde100 stress items were selected from each cohort,
dichotomized into no risk (=0) or risk (=1), and assigned to a domain
based on expert knowledge (see Figure~\ref{fig-1.1} for an overview of
included items). Within each domain, dichotomized risks were summed and
divided by the number of items in the domain. Finally, domain scores
were summed within periods to obtain prenatal and postnatal stress
scores.

\caption{\label{fig-1.1}\textbf{Temporal structure of the prenatal and
postnatal early-life stress (ELS) score}}

\end{figure}%

\begin{fakecaption}
The two graphs summarize the complex temporal structure of the prenatal (on the left) and postnatal (on the right) ELS scores. Time is depicted on the x-axis on the scale of weeks (gestation) for prenatal and years for postnatal items. For each question/item on the y-axis, a coloured dot represents the timepoint(s) at which the item was measured, and a grey shadow indicates the time period the question refers to (e.g., "since pregnancy" or "in the last year"). Red dots and labels refer to ALSPAC items and blue dots/labels refer to Generation R items. Items are grouped by domain, as indicated by the background color (yellow for life events, red for contextual risk, blue for parental risk, green for interpersonal risk and purple for direct victimization). The solid black vertical line indicates the beginning of the exposure period of interest, i.e., conception (or start of pregnancy) for prenatal items and birth for postnatal items. The dashed grey lines additionally provide temporal markers, i.e., trimesters in the prenatal period and a span of 1 year in the postnatal period.
\end{fakecaption}

\subsubsection{Internalizing symptoms}\label{internalizing-symptoms}

Internalizing symptoms were measured at an average age of 13.5 years
(range: 12.5-16.8 years) using the Child behavior checklist (CBCL 6-18)
(Achenbach, 1999) in GenR and the Strengths and difficulties
questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman et al., 2000) in ALSPAC. Both instruments
are well-validated parental reports of emotional and behavioral
functioning referring to the past 6 months, and have been shown to be
comparable (Goodman \& Scott, 1999). The CBCL internalizing subscale
consists of 32 items rated on a 3-point scale, e.g., \emph{``my child
feels worthless or inferior''}. The SDQ emotional problems subscale
contains 5 items rated on a 3-point scale, e.g., \emph{``often unhappy,
down-hearted or tearful''}.

\subsubsection{Adiposity (fat mass)}\label{adiposity-fat-mass}

Body composition was measured using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) scanner at an average age of 13.5 years (range: 12.5-16.6 years).
Technical details of these measurements are provided elsewhere (Boyd et
al., 2013; Voortman et al., 2016). Fat mass percentage was calculated by
dividing the total body fat mass (kg) by the weight (kg) and multiplying
by 100. To explore the importance of body fat distribution, measurements
of android fat mass were also extracted from DXA scans.

\subsubsection{Comorbidity}\label{comorbidity}

To compute psycho-cardiometabolic comorbidity, internalizing symptoms
and fat mass percentage were first dichotomized into high versus
low-moderate, based on a cohort-specific 80th percentile cut-off value.
The dichotomized values were then used to assign children to four
groups: ``healthy'' (both outcomes \textless80th percentile); ``high
internalizing'' (internalizing \textgreater80th \& fat mass percentage
≤80th); ``high adiposity'' (internalizing ≤80th \& fat mass percentage
\textgreater80th); and ``comorbid'' (both outcomes \textgreater80th
percentile). For additional information see Table~\ref{tbl-1.1} and
online \textbf{Supplement 2}.

\subsubsection{Covariates}\label{covariates}

During pregnancy, mothers reported on their smoking status, alcohol
consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Information about
child sex and date of birth was extracted from registries. Ethnic
background (only available for GenR children) was determined by
questionnaire-based assessment of the country of origin of participants'
parents. Following Statistics Netherlands' guidelines (Alders, 2001), if
one of the parents was born abroad, the child's ethnicity was determined
according to that parent. If both parents were born abroad, the child
was classified according to the mother's birthplace. Six large national
groups were identified (i.e., Cape Verdean, Dutch, Dutch Antillean,
Moroccan, Surinamese, and Turkish). Smaller national groups were
aggregated into five additional categories: ``Africa and Middle East'',
``Asia and Oceania'', ``Europe'', ``Latin America'', and ``North
America'' (\textbf{Figure S5}). See Table~\ref{tbl-1.1} and online
\textbf{Supplement 3} for additional information on covariates
measurement and distribution.

\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}

Analyses were run separately in the two cohorts, using R version 4.0.3
(R Core Team, 2021) All scripts are available on the project
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/association-ELS-PCM-project}{GitHub
repository}. Missing values in the exposure, covariate and outcome
variables were imputed by conditional multiple imputation (Van Buuren,
2018) using 60 iterations and 30 imputed datasets (for a complete
assessment of missing values and detailed imputation strategy see
\textbf{Supplement 4} and \textbf{Table S1}, available online). Model
parameters were fit in each imputed dataset and then pooled according to
Rubin's rules. Pre- and postnatal stress, internalizing and adiposity
were standardized using a z transformation. All statistical tests were
two-sided and interpreted at a p-value significance threshold of 0.05.
To account for multiple comparisons, false discovery rate (FDR)
correction was applied.

\subsubsection{Association of prenatal ELS with internalizing symptoms
and
adiposity}\label{association-of-prenatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity}

For each continuous outcome (i.e., internalizing and adiposity), we
performed a causal mediation analysis featuring prenatal stress as the
exposure and postnatal stress as mediator (Wang \& Arah, 2015). The
method is described in detail in online \textbf{Supplement 5}. In
summary, the ``total'' effect of prenatal ELS on each outcome was
decomposed into a direct (i.e., not due to postnatal ELS) and indirect
pathway (i.e., acting through postnatal ELS), allowing us to quantify
the direct and mediated contribution of prenatal stress.

\subsubsection{Association of postnatal ELS with internalizing symptoms
and
adiposity}\label{association-of-postnatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity}

For each continuous outcome, four multiple linear regression models were
run: 1) baseline (covariate only) model; 2) prenatal stress + covariates
model; 3) postnatal stress + covariates model; and 4) prenatal +
postnatal stress + covariates model. The baseline model served as
reference for the computation of R\textsubscript{inc}\^{}2; the prenatal
model was used to ensure comparability of estimates between approaches.

\subsubsection{Association of prenatal and postnatal ELS with
comorbidity}\label{association-of-prenatal-and-postnatal-els-with-comorbidity}

For the combined comorbidity outcome, two multinomial logistic
regression models were performed, using the ``healthy'' group as
reference, and pre-/postnatal stress as independent predictors. The odds
ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of developing comorbidity
were visually compared to those of developing high internalizing and
high adiposity only, to determine whether pre-/postnatal stress
influence comorbidity beyond either health problem alone.

\subsubsection{Follow-up and sensitivity
analyses}\label{follow-up-and-sensitivity-analyses}

We examined effect modification by sex and by ethnic background - in
GenR only, given its multi-ethnical composition (Kooijman et al., 2016).
Additionally, to explore the relative contribution of different types of
stress, three regression models (for internalizing, adiposity and
comorbidity) were run including all 9 domain scores (4 prenatal and 5
postnatal) as independent predictors.

To assess the impact of the imputation procedure on our results, we ran
the analyses in the subsample with complete outcome data (i.e., both
internalizing and adiposity). Finally, we tested the stability of our
results using android fat mass as an alternative measure of adiposity.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Sample descriptives}\label{sample-descriptives}

Sample characteristics were pooled across imputed datasets and
summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-1.1}. Briefly, the ALSPAC sample included
8428 (48\% male) children, whose mothers were 30\% highly educated
(i.e., held a college or university degree). The GenR sample included
4268 (52\% male) participants, 62\% of which were ``Dutch'' and 14\% had
highly educated (i.e., ``higher, phase 2'') mothers. Pre- and postnatal
ELS were moderately correlated (r = GenR: 0.56; ALSPAC: 0.48; see online
Supplement 1), whereas the correlation between internalizing symptoms
and adiposity was weak (r = GenR: 0.15; ALSPAC: 0.11).

\subsection{Associations of prenatal ELS with internalizing symptoms and
adiposity}\label{associations-of-prenatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity}

Results of the mediation analysis linking prenatal stress to
internalizing and adiposity were highly consistent across cohorts (see
Figure~\ref{fig-1.2} and online \textbf{Table S2}).

About \textasciitilde60\% of the total effect (TE) of prenatal stress on
internalizing symptoms (TE {[}95\%CI{]} = GenR: 0.27 {[}0.23;0.30{]};
ALSPAC: 0.16 {[}0.13;0.18{]}) was mediated through postnatal stress
(GenR: 0.16 {[}0.14;0.19{]}; ALSPAC: 0.10 {[}0.08;0.11{]}). The TE of
prenatal stress on adiposity (GenR: 0.12 {[}0.09;0.15{]}; ALSPAC: 0.04
{[}0.03;0.06{]}) was smaller compared to internalizing and largely
(\textasciitilde70\%) operating via the direct pathway (GenR: 0.08
{[}0.04;0.12{]}; ALSPAC: 0.03 {[}0.01;0.05{]}).

\subsection{Association of postnatal ELS with internalizing symptoms and
adiposity}\label{association-of-postnatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity-1}

Results of the hierarchical regressions examining the association of
postnatal stress with internalizing and adiposity were also largely
similar across cohorts (see Figure~\ref{fig-1.3}; online \textbf{Tables
S3 and S4}).

Higher postnatal stress associated with increased internalizing symptoms
both before (\(\beta\) {[}95\%CI{]} = GenR: 0.33 {[}0.29;0.37{]};
ALSPAC: 0.22 {[}0.19;0.25{]}) and after adjustment for prenatal stress
(GenR: 0.27 {[}0.22;0.31{]}; ALSPAC: 0.19 {[}0.15;0.22{]}).

Higher postnatal stress also associated with increased adiposity (GenR:
0.10 {[}0.07;0.13{]}; ALSPAC: 0.03 {[}0.01;0.05{]}). The association
remained after prenatal stress adjustment in GenR (0.07
{[}0.03;0.11{]}), but not in ALSPAC (0.02 {[}0.00;0.05{]}).

\subsection{Association of prenatal and postnatal ELS with
comorbidity}\label{association-of-prenatal-and-postnatal-els-with-comorbidity-1}

Higher stress in the prenatal (OR {[}95\%CI{]} = GenR: 2.13
{[}1.84;2.47{]}; ALSPAC: 1.48 {[}1.28;1.71{]}) and postnatal periods
(GenR: 2.37 {[}2.05;2.75{]}; ALSPAC: 1.61 {[}1.39;1.87{]}) was
associated with higher odds of belonging to the comorbidity group
compared to the healthy group (see Figure~\ref{fig-1.4} and online
\textbf{Table S5}). This association was the strongest compared to all
other (single-outcome) groups. However, the CIs of the comorbidity
estimates did overlap with those of high internalizing only
(Figure~\ref{fig-1.4} C and D).

\subsection{Follow-up analyses}\label{follow-up-analyses}

\subsubsection{Interaction with sex and ethnic
background}\label{interaction-with-sex-and-ethnic-background}

After stratifying by sex, in GenR, the association between prenatal ELS
and adiposity was larger in girls than in boys (\emph{Z}=1.89,
\emph{p}=.029), whereas that of postnatal ELS was slightly larger in
boys (\emph{Z}=-1.38, \emph{p}=.083). A similar pattern of associations
was found in ALSPAC but with smaller magnitudes (see \textbf{Figures
S2-S4} and \textbf{Tables S6-S9}, available online).

In GenR, Cape Verdian and Dutch Antillean children experienced the
highest cumulative prenatal and postnatal stress followed by Turkish,
Surinamese and Moroccan children (\textbf{Figure S5-B}). We did not find
evidence for a significant interaction between pre- or postnatal ELS and
the examined ethnic background groups on any outcome of interest (i.e.,
internalizing symptoms, adiposity or comorbidity; see \textbf{Table S10}
and \textbf{Figure S5-C}, available online). Note however that the
association between pre-/postnatal ELS and comorbidity in the ``North
American'' group could not be estimated due to insufficient number of
observations (i.e., comorbidity group size ≤ 5).

\subsubsection{Contribution of specific stress
domains}\label{contribution-of-specific-stress-domains}

Across cohorts, internalizing symptoms were consistently associated with
higher prenatal and postnatal parental risk (e.g., parental
psychopathology), postnatal life events and direct victimization (see
\textbf{Figure S6} and \textbf{Table S11}, available online). We found
no consistent associations for adiposity. Only postnatal parental risk
was consistently associated comorbidity status (vs.~healthy) across
cohorts (see \textbf{Figure S7} and \textbf{Table S12}, available
online).

\subsubsection{Sensitivity analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses}

Restricting the analyses to participants with complete outcome data (n =
GenR: 2749; ALSPAC: 4096) did not substantively change the reported
findings (see \textbf{Figure S8} and \textbf{Tables S13-S15}, available
online), nor did the use of android fat mass rather than fat mass
percentage as a proxy of adiposity (see \textbf{Figure S9} and
\textbf{Table S16}, available online). None of the main conclusions was
impacted by FDR correction.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our aim was to elucidate the role of ELS on adolescent internalizing
problems and adiposity, as well as their comorbidity, based on
prospective data from two population birth cohorts. We highlight two key
findings. Firstly, exposure to cumulative stress is strongly associated
with internalizing symptoms (especially postnatal ELS) and, to a lesser
extent, with adiposity (especially prenatal ELS). Secondly, both pre-
and postnatal stress associate with psycho-cardiometabolic comorbidity
more strongly than to individual health outcomes.

Our first objective was to disentangle the relative contribution of
prenatal and postnatal stress exposure to adolescent internalizing
symptoms and adiposity.

We found that, although both pre- and postnatal ELS contribute to
internalizing symptoms, the impact of postnatal stress is larger and it
is not explained by prenatal confounding, while \textasciitilde60\% of
the prenatal effect was mediated though postnatal stress. This finding
aligns with previous studies investigating the contribution of prenatal
and postnatal exposure to specific stressors (Clayborne et al., 2021;
Plant et al., 2015), and holds promising clinical implications given
that several aspects of the postnatal environment may be modifiable (Yap
et al., 2016). In particular, parental risk factors (such as
psychopathology), direct victimization (e.g., maltreatment) and life
events emerged as independent predictors of internalizing symptoms in
our exploratory analyses, indicating that these may represent important
targets for intervention.

To our knowledge, no study to date has explored such timing effects on
adiposity or related outcomes. Here, we found that \textasciitilde70\%
of the effect of prenatal stress on adiposity was ``direct'' (i.e., not
mediated by postnatal stress); the effect of postnatal stress, both as
mediator and as predictor in the adjusted models, was smaller and
resulted statistically significant only in GenR. While it is important
to note that the effect sizes observed in the adiposity models were
markedly smaller than for internalizing symptoms, these findings provide
some indication that fat accumulation processes could be particularly
vulnerable to (stress-induced) alterations of the prenatal environment.
This is in line with previous theoretical (Barker, 1998; Gluckman et
al., 2008) and empirical (Entringer et al., 2012; Entringer, 2013)
accounts showcasing the impact of stress and stress hormones during
prenatal life on the programming of metabolic function and obesity risk.
In our exploratory follow-up analyses, we additionally found some
evidence that adiposity may be more strongly associated with prenatal
stress in girls, versus postnatal stress in boys. However previous
accounts of these sex differences are mixed (Murphy \& Loria, 2017;
Paternain et al., 2013), and differences in pubertal development may be
an important confounding factor that was not accounted for in our
analysis.

It is also possible that stronger associations between postnatal ELS and
adiposity will emerge later in development. Indeed, accumulating
postnatal risks may influence biological (e.g., inflammatory and
neuro-endocrine) and behavioral factors (e.g., diet and exercise) that
in turn increase physical health burden, but this might become evident
only later in life (Danese \& Tan, 2014; Elsenburg et al., 2017).

Our second aim was to examine whether ELS relates to
psycho-cardiometabolic comorbidity, as suggested by some theoretical
accounts (Juster et al., 2016), but never explicitly investigated
before. If comorbidity was a discrete stress-related pathophysiological
process, then the effect of ELS on comorbidity would differ from the
effect of ELS on mental and physical health separately. This expectation
was partially confirmed by our data: ELS increased the risk of
developing comorbidity compared to being healthy and this estimate was
highest relative to all other groups. However, the overlap between CIs
of the comorbidity and the internalizing-only estimate indicates that
neither pre- nor postnatal stress levels were sufficient to predict
whether a child will develop comorbidity vs.~internalizing problems
alone. Notably, cross-sectional correlations between internalizing and
adiposity at age 13 were small (and so were the comorbidity group
sizes), which may partly explain these findings. However, comorbidity is
known to increase with age (Barnett et al., 2012) and it is possible
that pre- / postnatal stress may serve as better discriminators between
comorbidity and internalizing problems in older samples, with higher
comorbidity rates.

This study has several important strengths. We analysed data from two
large population-based cohorts with remarkably consistent results, which
adds confidence to the robustness and generalizability of our findings.
We used a longitudinal and comprehensive assessment of ELS, enabling us
to quantify the relative contribution of pre- and postnatal exposure to
a broad spectrum of stressors. We focused on two pre-clinical health
markers which manifest in adolescence and may be important targets for
early prevention. Also, the challenge of incomplete data and possible
selection bias was thoroughly addressed by multiple imputation and
sensitivity analyses. However, it is important to note that our measures
of ELS and internalizing symptoms rely primarily on parent reports,
which might have introduced information bias. Further, although several
important confounders were taken into account, it will be important in
the future to examine the role of other potential contributors,
including (epi-)genetic influences (Inoue et al., 2022), pubertal
status, disability/functional impairment and other behavioral factors
(e.g., sleep, exercise, diet).

In conclusion, current approaches to the prevention and management of
depression and obesity have yielded limited success. We believe the
adoption of an integrated, developmental framework is necessary to
improve our understanding and set the stage for better detection and
prevention of these disorders, both in isolation and in their comorbid
form. We provide evidence that both pre- and postnatal ELS associate
with adolescent internalizing symptoms (with prenatal \textless{}
postnatal stress), adiposity (with prenatal \textgreater{} postnatal
stress), and their comorbidity at age 13. While recommendations for how
to best intervene when a higher psychosocial stress burden is identified
are still at embryonic stage, one novel suggestion emerging from our
findings is that prenatal stress may be an underrecognized factor for
identifying children at higher risk of overweight. We would therefore
advice clinicians to enquire about prenatal stress exposure as part of
routine pediatric assessments, so that adequate monitoring and lifestyle
preventative measures can be introduced as early as infancy.

Finally, as we follow these children, it will be informative to see how
these associations evolve over time. For instance, the association
between ELS exposure and adiposity-related outcomes may not emerge fully
until adulthood and it is possible that the nature of the relation
between ELS and comorbidity also differs as a function of developmental
stage.

\chapter{General discussion}\label{general-discussion}

In this dissertation \ldots{} We focus on adolescence, a critical
developmental period, when many mental health problems first emerge, and
early signs of cardio-metabolic dysregulation begin to manifest. By
examining these relationships prospectively, this thesis seeks to
provide a clearer understanding of how ELS impacts psycho-physical
health during this formative stage of life.

I started this book with a confession: I hated writing this. Since you
meade it this far (or anyway happened to open this doomed chapter), you
won the dubious reward of knowing why. Here is a collection of thing I
would have done differently, followed by a few things I wish we all did
differently.

\section{Modelling ELS}\label{modelling-els}

\subsection{Parental reports}\label{parental-reports}

Like most previous literatures, children's stress exposure information
was obtained via parental report and thus likely reflect a combination
of parents' own stress experiences, psychological state, and
personality.

\subsection{Missing piece: resilience}\label{missing-piece-resilience}

\section{Alternative modelling
methods}\label{alternative-modelling-methods}

A cumulative risk approach examines the number of stressors experienced
rather than the intensity or the pattern of stress exposure. We define
stressors dichotomously and then sum across multiple dichotomous
exposures. As an additive model, this technique is a straightforward,
way of identifying children at increased odds for developing a range of
maladaptive outcomes, including cognitive deficits, behavioral
adjustment problems, and poor physical health.

Multiple stressors exposures can sometimes overlap (e.g., harsh and
unresponsive parenting) or be independent (e.g., life events), but in
each case prediction is enhanced by combining multiple risks in the
model. Multiple stressors exposures can sometimes overlap (e.g.,
material deprivation and overcrowding) or be independent (e.g., death of
a parent and overcrowding), but in each case prediction is enhanced by
combining multiple risks in the model. There are several advantages of
formulating indices of multiple stress exposures into a composite score.
Measurement error is reduced, validity is enhanced because no one
singular measure adequately captures the full meaning of the construct
of interest, avoids the issue of collinear predictors in the same
general linear model, which may lead to unstable estimates and diminish
statistical power. For example, many low-income families live in
substardard housing, located in high crime neighborhoods; their children
may attend schools with inadequate facilities, staffed by less
experienced teachers; and many live in single parent households.

it does not take into account interaction between the individual
stressors Singling out the effects of school noise exposure on reading
quality without taking into account these overlapping risk factors for
reading deficits could overestimate the harmful impacts of noise on
reading deficits. On the other hand, noise by itself may have negligible
impact on reading deficits except when accompanied by household
disadvantage or only if the exposure happens within the context of a
school with inadequate facilities and staff. In the latter case, by
isolating the singular impact of noise exposure as a risk factor for
reading deficits, we might erroneously conclude that noise does not
matter. It may in fact be a contributing risk factor for reading
deficits but only when considered within the natural ecological context
wherein high noise schools typically operate. Another way to think about
this is that perhaps there is no main effect of noise on reading
deficits but an interaction or moderator effect. Noise matters but only
in the presence of certain other variables. As we explain below however,
the use of an interactive, nonadditive model of multiple risk exposure
is often not possible when a large number of risk factors are under
consideration. Use of additive models of multiple risk factors is a
common approach for dealing with this dilemma.

than those with statistically significant results.
