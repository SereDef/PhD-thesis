Dear reader,

Let me begin this book the only way that feels right: with a little note
of honesty. Writing this was hard, much harder than I anticipated.
Perhaps out of pride, or because of this irresistible greed I feel to
dissect and point out limitations - that, I am told, makes for a good
scientist as much as a horrible friend - I kept wondering whether any of
this would be worth your time.

I guess 5-years-ago me hoped, at this point, they could promise you
sensational scientific breakthroughs and game-changing statistical
tricks ahead. Well, it looks like we may both have to settle for a
somewhat less glamourous, but perhaps more truthful, process of
scientific discovery.

So here is a collection of small steps toward understanding, many little
increments of knowledge, a couple of false starts, a few frustratingly
inconclusive results, and a handful of insights (some grim, some
hopeful).

Still here? Didn't think so\ldots{} let's talk about early-life stress,
shall we?

\chapter{General Introduction}\label{sec-chapter1}

\section{Early-life stress (ELS)}\label{early-life-stress-els}

When my mother was pregnant with me, my older brother died of a
congenital condition. I never met the little guy, never experienced any
grief myself. Yet, for the longest time I thought that, somehow, his
death had cast a sort of shadow over the rest of my life. And I was not
the only one. The idea that exposure to stressful experiences during
\emph{``critical'' periods} of early development wields profound,
long-term impact on emotional and physiological regulation, is nothing
new. Sigmund Freud, among others, made quite a sensational career out of
it, and - perhaps partly because of the success of psychoanalytic
theories - the scientific literature on the topic today is almost
intimidatingly vast.

So vast in fact, that it requires a pinch of terminology clarification,
before we can dive into it. For the remainder of this book, I will use
the term ``Early-Life Stress'' (ELS) to refer to a host of adverse life
events or conditions, that are experienced during the first years of
life, e.g., in childhood, and, even earlier, during gestation. These
experiences (sometimes also referred to as ``childhood trauma'',
``maltreatment'', ``early adversity'', or ``adverse childhood
experiences'') encompass a wide range of stressors, including neglect
and abuse, bereavement, bullying but also poverty, material deprivation
and/or parental psychopathology (Heim, 2020).

ELS is a widely studied concept, partly because it is surprisingly
common: more than half the population experiences at least one form of
ELS before the age of 18 years (Madigan et al., 2024). But more
importantly, ELS is one of strongest, most consistent predictors of
mental health problems later in life, particularly depression (LeMoult
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2016; Li et al., 2023).

Systematic scientific investigations into ELS and its consequences,
really gained momentum in the late 90s, when large-scale epidemiological
studies, began to also highlight a relationship between ELS and an
increased risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality (e.g.
(Felitti et al., 1998)). This line of evidence also proved very robust
over time, so ELS is now a well-recognised risk factor for
cardio-metabolic health problems, including obesity (Danese \& Tan,
2014; Wiss \& Brewerton, 2020), type 2 diabetes (Zhu et al., 2022),
hypertension and cardio-vascular disease (Jacquet-Smailovic et al.,
2022; Jakubowski et al., 2018).

\section{Mental \& physical health: a comorbidity
paradigm}\label{mental-physical-health-a-comorbidity-paradigm}

Interestingly, parallel to this growing interest in the effects of
stress and psychosocial factors on physical health, the early 2000s also
witnessed a surge of epidemiological studies uncovering the relationship
between depression and cardio-metabolic health problems(Luppino et al.,
2010; Penninx et al., 2001; Van der Kooy et al., 2007). Historically,
these two conditions had been largely investigated as separate entities,
each with distinct risk factors and treatment approaches. Their
connection was not entirely overlooked (see for example early
theoretical work by Engel (1977)), but it remained peripheral to
mainstream medical research until relatively recently.

As more evidence accumulated that depression and cardio-metabolic
conditions tend to co-occur (Anwar et al., 2018; Blasco et al., 2020;
Gutiérrez-Rojas et al., 2020), several potential mechanisms have been
proposed to explain this observed comorbidity (Milaneschi et al., 2019).
One possibility is that these conditions share common risk factors, such
as genetic liability for instance, but also ELS exposure, as discussed
above and supported by a recent large scale meta-analysis (Souama et
al., 2023). It is also possible that experiencing depression may
directly increase the risk of developing cardio-metabolic health
problems later in life. For example, in two meta-analyses based on
longitudinal data, depression was found to be risk factor for obesity
and diabetes (Ditmars et al., 2022; Mannan et al., 2016). Other
longitudinal meta-analyses however, have also shown, in turn, that poor
cardio-metabolic health was a robust predictor of later depression (Zhou
et al., 2024), supporting the hypothesis of a bi-directional
relationship.

\section{ELS and psycho-physical health: towards an integrated
approach}\label{els-and-psycho-physical-health-towards-an-integrated-approach}

So far, we have described a triangle of relationships - i.e., between
\emph{a)} ELS and mental health, \emph{b)} ELS and cardio-metabolic
health, and \emph{c)} mental and cardio-metabolic health
(Figure~\ref{fig-thesis-summary} A), which received considerable
attention in the medical literature. This isn't surprising. Depression
and cardio-metabolic conditions are among the leading causes of death
and disability worldwide, shaping an enormous public health burden which
is largely preventable (Anwar et al., 2018). ELS is a promising shared
risk factor, which can be measured years - and even decades - before
clinical symptoms emerge, making it an ideal candidate for informing
early detection and improving the integrated prevention of
psycho-physical health problems.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-thesis-summary}\textbf{Schematic representation of
this thesis, in the context of previous literature}\newline(A) A
schematic summary of the existing evidence, on the relationships under
study. This is largely based on adult outcomes and retrospectively
measured ELS exposure (indicated by the dashed line).\newline(B) A
Schematic summary of the relationships examined in this thesis.}

\end{figure}%

However, there are three key challenges that need to be addressed,
before these findings could be effectively translated into clinical
practice.

Firstly, as briefly noted above, the literature is very heterogenous in
its definition of ELS, with many studies focusing on specific types of
adversity (e.g., childhood neglect and abuse). However, there is
convincing evidence that exposure to multiple stressors - i.e.,
different sources of stress, as well as repeated or continued exposure
over time - has much worse consequences for psycho-physical health,
compared to individual stressors (Evans et al., 2013; Hughes et al.,
2017). This underscores the importance of identifying of children who
face multiple forms of ELS, as they may represent a particularly
vulnerable population, who should be prioritized in intervention
programs.

Secondly, existing studies typically only address one ``side'' of this
triad of relationships. For instance, while ELS has been linked to both
depression and obesity independently, its role in determining their
co-occurrence remains heavily understudied. Consequently, it is hard to
establish the relative importance of ELS as a risk factor for each
disorder in isolation vs.~their comorbidity, which poses an obstacle to
the development of integrated prevention and intervention (Anwar et al.,
2018).

Lastly, the overwhelming majority of studies investigating either the
role of ELS, or the(bidirectional) relationships between mental and
physical health, has been conducted in adult or aging populations.

On one hand, this brings about important measurement issues. Namely, the
proposed relationship between ELS and adult psycho-physical health
relies heavily on retrospective reports of ELS exposure, which may have
introduced recall bias, unrealistically inflating the association
estimates reported by the literature (Reuben et al., 2016).

On the other hand, both depression and cardio-metabolic health problems
very often find their onset well before adulthood. A growing number of
adolescents, for instance, experience depressive symptoms before the age
of 20 years (Keeley, 2021; Patalay \& Gage, 2019). Concurrently, while
cardio-metabolic endpoints such as myocardial infarction and diabetes
are traditionally associated with later life stages, their prodromal
forms, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, manifest more
and more frequently between childhood and adolescence (NCD-RisC, 2017;
WHO, 2022). Intervening during this early developmental window could be
crucial to mitigate the progression of such prodromal psycho-physical
symptoms into chronic mental and physical health conditions later in
life.

In this context, prospective cohort studies that begin at conception and
capture a broader spectrum of ELS exposures and psycho-physical
symptoms, are essential to map causal pathways and inform on optimal
intervention windows.

\section{This thesis: one step back in
time}\label{this-thesis-one-step-back-in-time}

This thesis (Figure~\ref{fig-thesis-summary} B) aims to address some of
these limitations and open questions.

\textbf{Part 1} will focus on characterizing the prospective
relationship between ELS and adolescent psycho-physical health. First,
in Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter2}, I quantify the relationship between ELS
exposure during two key developmental periods (i.e.~pregnancy and
childhood) and adolescent \emph{a)} internalizing symptoms, \emph{b)}
adiposity, and \emph{c)} their comorbidity. Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter3}
further explores wether three common lifestyle factors (i.e., physical
activity, sleep duration, and diet quality) may moderate the
associations identified in Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter2}. I will then take
a closer look at the potential ``biological scars'' that pre- and
postnatal ELS exposure may leave behind on children's brains
(Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter4}) and on their hearts
(Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter5}).

In \textbf{Part 2} I will then characterize the reciprocal relationship
between mental and cardio-metabolic health across childhood and
adolescence. Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter6} examines the longitudinal
co-development of depressive symptoms and several markers of
cardio-metabolic health from childhood to early adulthood. In
Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter7}, I assess the relationship between early
cardio-vascular health markers (i.e., arterial health and blood
pressure) and the developing brain.

\markright{Abstract}

\ul{Objective}: Depression and obesity are two highly prevalent and
often comorbid conditions. Exposure to early-life stress (ELS) has been
associated with both depression and obesity in adulthood, as well as
their preclinical manifestations during development. However, it remains
unclear whether: \emph{(i)} associations differ depending on the timing
of stress exposure (prenatal vs postnatal) and \emph{(ii)} ELS is a
shared risk factor underlying the comorbidity between the two
conditions.

\ul{Methods}: Leveraging data from two large population-based birth
cohorts (ALSPAC: n=8428 (52\% male participants); Generation R: n=4268
(48\% male participants)), we constructed comprehensive cumulative
measures of prenatal (in utero) and postnatal (from birth to 10 years)
ELS. At age 13.5 years we assessed: a) internalizing symptoms (using
maternal reports); b) fat mass percentage (using dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry); c) their comorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of
high internalizing and high adiposity.

\ul{Results}: Both prenatal (\emph{total effect} {[}95\%CI{]} = 0.20
{[}0.16; 0.22{]}) and postnatal stress (\(\beta\) {[}95\%CI{]} = 0.22
{[}0.17; 0.25{]}) were associated with higher internalizing symptoms,
with evidence of a more prominent role of postnatal stress. A weaker
association (primarily driven by prenatal stress) was observed between
stress and adiposity (prenatal: 0.07 {[}0.05; 0.09{]}; postnatal: 0.04
{[}0.01; 0.07{]}). Both pre- (OR {[}95\%CI{]} = 1.70 {[}1.47; 1.97{]})
and postnatal stress (1.87 {[}1.61; 2.17{]}) were associated with an
increased risk of developing comorbidity.

\ul{Conclusions}: We found evidence of \emph{(i)} timing and \emph{(ii)}
shared causal effects of ELS on psycho-cardiometabolic health in
adolescence, but future research is warranted to clarify how these
associations may unfold over time.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The co-occurrence of depression and obesity is a rising public health
concern, affecting increasingly younger populations (Sutaria et al.,
2019). Individuals with obesity are \textasciitilde30-40\% more likely
to develop depression compared to the general population
(Pereira-Miranda et al., 2017). In turn, depression also increases the
risk of developing obesity (Pratt \& Brody, 2014) and related
cardiometabolic disease (Hare et al., 2014). While the relationship
between depression and adiposity is likely multifactorial and complex,
the observed comorbidity between the two may be partially explained by
shared environmental risk factors, such as exposure to stressful
experiences early in life (Shonkoff et al., 2012).

Indeed, early-life stress (ELS) is a well-established risk factor for
both adult depression (Li et al., 2016) and obesity (Danese \& Tan,
2014). In children and adolescents, ELS exposure in utero and
postnatally (e.g., adverse childhood experiences) have been separately
linked to preclinical manifestations of depression, such as
internalizing problems (Cecil et al., 2017; Van den Bergh et al., 2020),
and several adiposity measures (Burgueño et al., 2020; Elsenburg et al.,
2017).

Identifying critical exposure windows (i.e., prenatal vs postnatal) can
provide important insights into the best timing for prevention and
intervention programs, and shed light on the mechanisms through which
stress may lead to disease (Hartman \& Belsky, 2018). However, very few
studies prospectively investigated the influence of both pre- and
postnatal stress on these outcomes, and, because stress shows continuity
over time, it is unclear whether \emph{(a)} previously reported
postnatal associations may partly reflect preceding prenatal exposures
(i.e., prenatal ELS as confounder), and \emph{(b)} observed prenatal
associations may be partly mediated by postnatal ELS (i.e., postnatal
ELS as mediator).

Further, existing studies have examined ELS associations with
internalizing and adiposity either separately (Slopen et al., 2014) or
as part of a broader ``multisystemic'' disease constructs (Juster et
al., 2016). It remains unknown whether ELS represents a shared risk
factor for comorbid emotional problems and adiposity. Establishing such
association is important, since protocols for the integrated detection
and management of these health conditions are lacking (Anwar et al.,
2018), and differential patterns of ELS exposure may help identify
subgroups of adolescents at higher risk for comorbidity.

To address these gaps, we leveraged longitudinal data from two
population-based prospective birth cohorts to examine \emph{(i)} how
pre- and postnatal ELS (up to age 10 years) associate to internalizing
symptoms and adiposity in early adolescence (i.e., at age 13 years),
taking into account potential confounding and mediation effects; and
\emph{(ii)} whether ELS accounts for comorbidity between internalizing
problems and excess adiposity, above its contribution to each health
outcome individually. Based on previous findings, we expect that both
pre- and postnatal ELS prospectively associate with internalizing
symptoms and adiposity, as well as their comorbidity. No a priori
hypotheses were specified regarding the relative importance of pre- vs
postnatal ELS.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

This manuscript follows STROBE guidelines (Elm et al., 2008).

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Our sample was drawn from two population-based cohorts: the Generation R
Study (GenR), including 9,778 pregnant women in Rotterdam (the
Netherlands), who delivered their babies between April 2002 and January
2006 (Kooijman et al., 2016); and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children (ALSPAC) involving 14,541 pregnant women in Avon (UK), with
delivery dates between April 1991 and December 1992 (Boyd et al., 2013;
Fraser et al., 2013). The
\href{http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/}{ALSPAC
website} contains details of all the data that is available through a
fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool.

Response rates at the 13 years follow-up were 64\% in GenR and 61\% in
ALSPAC. Participants with \textgreater{} 50\% missing ELS variables in
the pre- or postnatal period were excluded, as were all twins. In the
case of non-twin siblings, only one was selected (see Figure S1,
available online). The final sample included 4268 (GenR) and 8428
(ALSPAC) children.

\subsubsection{Ethical standards}\label{ethical-standards}

Ethical approval was obtained from the medical ethical committee of
Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam and from the ALSPAC
Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees.
Written informed consent was obtained for all participants and both
studies conform with the World Medical Association Declaration of
Helsinki (2013).

\subsection{Measures}\label{measures}

\subsubsection{Prenatal and postnatal
ELS}\label{prenatal-and-postnatal-els}

The prenatal (i.e., maternal exposure during pregnancy) and postnatal
(i.e.~from birth to 10 years) cumulative ELS scores comprise information
about five stress domains in line with previous literature (Cecil et
al., 2014; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2016): life events (e.g., death of a
parent), contextual risk (e.g., financial difficulties), parental risk
(e.g., parental psychopathology), interpersonal risk (e.g., family
conflicts) and direct victimization (only postnatally, e.g.~maltreatment
or bullying). Note that, consistent with other work using this measure
(Schuurmans et al., 2022), we use the term ``postnatal'' (in contrast to
``prenatal'') to encompass stressors experienced across childhood (i.e.,
until the age of 10 years), rather than immediately following birth. A
detailed description of the ELS scores is provided in online
\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Supplement 1}} (see also the score's
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/cumulative-ELS-score}{GitHub
repository} for further details and scripts). Briefly,
\textasciitilde100 stress items were selected from each cohort,
dichotomized into no risk (=0) or risk (=1), and assigned to a domain
based on expert knowledge (see Figure~\ref{fig-2.1} for an overview of
included items). Within each domain, dichotomized risks were summed and
divided by the number of items in the domain. Finally, domain scores
were summed within periods to obtain prenatal and postnatal stress
scores.

\subsubsection{Internalizing symptoms}\label{internalizing-symptoms}

Internalizing symptoms were measured at an average age of 13.5 years
(range: 12.5-16.8 years) using the Child behavior checklist (CBCL 6-18)
(Achenbach, 1999) in GenR and the Strengths and difficulties
questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman et al., 2000) in ALSPAC. Both instruments
are well-validated parental reports of emotional and behavioral
functioning referring to the past 6 months, and have been shown to be
comparable (Goodman \& Scott, 1999). The CBCL internalizing subscale
consists of 32 items rated on a 3-point scale, e.g., \emph{``my child
feels worthless or inferior''}. The SDQ emotional problems subscale
contains 5 items rated on a 3-point scale, e.g., \emph{``often unhappy,
down-hearted or tearful''}.

\subsubsection{Adiposity (fat mass)}\label{adiposity-fat-mass}

Body composition was measured using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) scanner at an average age of 13.5 years (range: 12.5-16.6 years).
Technical details of these measurements are provided elsewhere (Boyd et
al., 2013; Voortman et al., 2016). Fat mass percentage was calculated by
dividing the total body fat mass (kg) by the weight (kg) and multiplying
by 100. To explore the importance of body fat distribution, measurements
of android fat mass were also extracted from DXA scans.

\subsubsection{Comorbidity}\label{comorbidity}

To compute psycho-cardiometabolic comorbidity, internalizing symptoms
and fat mass percentage were first dichotomized into high versus
low-moderate, based on a cohort-specific 80th percentile cut-off value.
The dichotomized values were then used to assign children to four
groups: ``healthy'' (both outcomes \textless80th percentile); ``high
internalizing'' (internalizing \textgreater80th \& fat mass percentage
≤80th); ``high adiposity'' (internalizing ≤80th \& fat mass percentage
\textgreater80th); and ``comorbid'' (both outcomes \textgreater80th
percentile). For additional information see Table~\ref{tbl-2.1} and
online \href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Supplement 2}}.

postnatal early-life stress (ELS) score}}

\end{figure}%

\begin{fakecaption}
The two graphs summarize the complex temporal structure of the prenatal (on the left) and postnatal (on the right) ELS scores. Time is depicted on the x-axis on the scale of weeks (gestation) for prenatal and years for postnatal items. For each question/item on the y-axis, a coloured dot represents the timepoint(s) at which the item was measured, and a grey shadow indicates the time period the question refers to (e.g., "since pregnancy" or "in the last year"). Red dots and labels refer to ALSPAC items and blue dots/labels refer to Generation R items. Items are grouped by domain, as indicated by the background color (yellow for life events, red for contextual risk, blue for parental risk, green for interpersonal risk and purple for direct victimization). The solid black vertical line indicates the beginning of the exposure period of interest, i.e., conception (or start of pregnancy) for prenatal items and birth for postnatal items. The dashed grey lines additionally provide temporal markers, i.e., trimesters in the prenatal period and a span of 1 year in the postnatal period.
\end{fakecaption}

\subsubsection{Covariates}\label{covariates}

During pregnancy, mothers reported on their smoking status, alcohol
consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Information about
child sex and date of birth was extracted from registries. Ethnic
background (only available for GenR children) was determined by
questionnaire-based assessment of the country of origin of participants'
parents. Following Statistics Netherlands' guidelines (Alders, 2001), if
one of the parents was born abroad, the child's ethnicity was determined
according to that parent. If both parents were born abroad, the child
was classified according to the mother's birthplace. Six large national
groups were identified (i.e., Cape Verdean, Dutch, Dutch Antillean,
Moroccan, Surinamese, and Turkish). Smaller national groups were
aggregated into five additional categories: ``Africa and Middle East'',
``Asia and Oceania'', ``Europe'', ``Latin America'', and ``North
America'' (\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figure S5}}). See
Table~\ref{tbl-2.1} and online
\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Supplement 3}} for additional
information on covariates measurement and distribution.

\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}

Analyses were run separately in the two cohorts, using R version 4.0.3
(R Core Team, 2021) All scripts are available on the project
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/association-ELS-PCM-project}{GitHub
repository}. Missing values in the exposure, covariate and outcome
variables were imputed by conditional multiple imputation (Van Buuren,
2018) using 60 iterations and 30 imputed datasets (for a complete
assessment of missing values and detailed imputation strategy see
\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Supplement 4}} and
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Table S1}}, available online). Model
parameters were fit in each imputed dataset and then pooled according to
Rubin's rules. Pre- and postnatal stress, internalizing and adiposity
were standardized using a z transformation. All statistical tests were
two-sided and interpreted at a p-value significance threshold of 0.05.
To account for multiple comparisons, false discovery rate (FDR)
correction was applied.

\subsubsection{Association of prenatal ELS with internalizing symptoms
and
adiposity}\label{association-of-prenatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity}

For each continuous outcome (i.e., internalizing and adiposity), we
performed a causal mediation analysis featuring prenatal stress as the
exposure and postnatal stress as mediator (Wang \& Arah, 2015). The
method is described in detail in online
\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Supplement 5}}. In summary, the
``total'' effect of prenatal ELS on each outcome was decomposed into a
direct (i.e., not due to postnatal ELS) and indirect pathway (i.e.,
acting through postnatal ELS), allowing us to quantify the direct and
mediated contribution of prenatal stress.

\subsubsection{Association of postnatal ELS with internalizing symptoms
and
adiposity}\label{association-of-postnatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity}

For each continuous outcome, four multiple linear regression models were
run: 1) baseline (covariate only) model; 2) prenatal stress + covariates
model; 3) postnatal stress + covariates model; and 4) prenatal +
postnatal stress + covariates model. The baseline model served as
reference for the computation of R\textsubscript{inc}\^{}2; the prenatal
model was used to ensure comparability of estimates between approaches.

\subsubsection{Association of prenatal and postnatal ELS with
comorbidity}\label{association-of-prenatal-and-postnatal-els-with-comorbidity}

For the combined comorbidity outcome, two multinomial logistic
regression models were performed, using the ``healthy'' group as
reference, and pre-/postnatal stress as independent predictors. The odds
ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of developing comorbidity
were visually compared to those of developing high internalizing and
high adiposity only, to determine whether pre-/postnatal stress
influence comorbidity beyond either health problem alone.

\subsubsection{Follow-up and sensitivity
analyses}\label{follow-up-and-sensitivity-analyses}

We examined effect modification by sex and by ethnic background - in
GenR only, given its multi-ethnical composition (Kooijman et al., 2016).
Additionally, to explore the relative contribution of different types of
stress, three regression models (for internalizing, adiposity and
comorbidity) were run including all 9 domain scores (4 prenatal and 5
postnatal) as independent predictors.

To assess the impact of the imputation procedure on our results, we ran
the analyses in the subsample with complete outcome data (i.e., both
internalizing and adiposity). Finally, we tested the stability of our
results using android fat mass as an alternative measure of adiposity.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Sample descriptives}\label{sample-descriptives}

Sample characteristics were pooled across imputed datasets and
summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-2.1}. Briefly, the ALSPAC sample included
8428 (48\% male) children, whose mothers were 30\% highly educated
(i.e., held a college or university degree). The GenR sample included
4268 (52\% male) participants, 62\% of which were ``Dutch'' and 14\% had
highly educated (i.e., ``higher, phase 2'') mothers. Pre- and postnatal
ELS were moderately correlated (r = GenR: 0.56; ALSPAC: 0.48; see online
Supplement 1), whereas the correlation between internalizing symptoms
and adiposity was weak (r = GenR: 0.15; ALSPAC: 0.11).

\subsection{Associations of prenatal ELS with internalizing symptoms and
adiposity}\label{associations-of-prenatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity}

Results of the mediation analysis linking prenatal stress to
internalizing and adiposity were highly consistent across cohorts (see
Figure~\ref{fig-2.2} and online \href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Table
S2}}).

About \textasciitilde60\% of the total effect (TE) of prenatal stress on
internalizing symptoms (TE {[}95\%CI{]} = GenR: 0.27 {[}0.23;0.30{]};
ALSPAC: 0.16 {[}0.13;0.18{]}) was mediated through postnatal stress
(GenR: 0.16 {[}0.14;0.19{]}; ALSPAC: 0.10 {[}0.08;0.11{]}). The TE of
prenatal stress on adiposity (GenR: 0.12 {[}0.09;0.15{]}; ALSPAC: 0.04
{[}0.03;0.06{]}) was smaller compared to internalizing and largely
(\textasciitilde70\%) operating via the direct pathway (GenR: 0.08
{[}0.04;0.12{]}; ALSPAC: 0.03 {[}0.01;0.05{]}).

\subsection{Association of postnatal ELS with internalizing symptoms and
adiposity}\label{association-of-postnatal-els-with-internalizing-symptoms-and-adiposity-1}

Results of the hierarchical regressions examining the association of
postnatal stress with internalizing and adiposity were also largely
similar across cohorts (see Figure~\ref{fig-2.3}; online
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Tables S3 and S4}}).

Higher postnatal stress associated with increased internalizing symptoms
both before (\(\beta\) {[}95\%CI{]} = GenR: 0.33 {[}0.29;0.37{]};
ALSPAC: 0.22 {[}0.19;0.25{]}) and after adjustment for prenatal stress
(GenR: 0.27 {[}0.22;0.31{]}; ALSPAC: 0.19 {[}0.15;0.22{]}).

Higher postnatal stress also associated with increased adiposity (GenR:
0.10 {[}0.07;0.13{]}; ALSPAC: 0.03 {[}0.01;0.05{]}). The association
remained after prenatal stress adjustment in GenR (0.07
{[}0.03;0.11{]}), but not in ALSPAC (0.02 {[}0.00;0.05{]}).

latter quantifies the increase in variance explained due to the
introduction of the predictor (compared to the covariate only model).}

\subsection{Association of prenatal and postnatal ELS with
comorbidity}\label{association-of-prenatal-and-postnatal-els-with-comorbidity-1}

Higher stress in the prenatal (OR {[}95\%CI{]} = GenR: 2.13
{[}1.84;2.47{]}; ALSPAC: 1.48 {[}1.28;1.71{]}) and postnatal periods
(GenR: 2.37 {[}2.05;2.75{]}; ALSPAC: 1.61 {[}1.39;1.87{]}) was
associated with higher odds of belonging to the comorbidity group
compared to the healthy group (see Figure~\ref{fig-2.4} and online
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Table S5}}). This association was the
strongest compared to all other (single-outcome) groups. However, the
CIs of the comorbidity estimates did overlap with those of high
internalizing only (Figure~\ref{fig-2.4} C and D).

\subsection{Follow-up analyses}\label{follow-up-analyses}

\subsubsection{Interaction with sex and ethnic
background}\label{interaction-with-sex-and-ethnic-background}

After stratifying by sex, in GenR, the association between prenatal ELS
and adiposity was larger in girls than in boys (\emph{Z}=1.89,
\emph{p}=.029), whereas that of postnatal ELS was slightly larger in
boys (\emph{Z}=-1.38, \emph{p}=.083). A similar pattern of associations
was found in ALSPAC but with smaller magnitudes (see
\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figures S2-S4}} and
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Tables S6-S9}}, available online).

In GenR, Cape Verdian and Dutch Antillean children experienced the
highest cumulative prenatal and postnatal stress followed by Turkish,
Surinamese and Moroccan children
(\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figure S5-B}}). We did not find
evidence for a significant interaction between pre- or postnatal ELS and
the examined ethnic background groups on any outcome of interest (i.e.,
internalizing symptoms, adiposity or comorbidity; see
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Table S10}} and
\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figure S5-C}}, available online). Note
however that the association between pre-/postnatal ELS and comorbidity
in the ``North American'' group could not be estimated due to
insufficient number of observations (i.e., comorbidity group size ≤ 5).

\subsubsection{Contribution of specific stress
domains}\label{contribution-of-specific-stress-domains}

Across cohorts, internalizing symptoms were consistently associated with
higher prenatal and postnatal parental risk (e.g., parental
psychopathology), postnatal life events and direct victimization (see
\href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figure S6}} and
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Table S11}}, available online). We
found no consistent associations for adiposity. Only postnatal parental
risk was consistently associated comorbidity status (vs.~healthy) across
cohorts (see \href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figure S7}} and
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Table S12}}, available online).

\subsubsection{Sensitivity analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses}

Restricting the analyses to participants with complete outcome data (n =
GenR: 2749; ALSPAC: 4096) did not substantively change the reported
findings (see \href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figure S8}} and
\href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Tables S13-S15}}, available online),
nor did the use of android fat mass rather than fat mass percentage as a
proxy of adiposity (see \href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Figure S9}}
and \href{https://osf.io/7e4x8}{\emph{Table S16}}, available online).
None of the main conclusions was impacted by FDR correction.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our aim was to elucidate the role of ELS on adolescent internalizing
problems and adiposity, as well as their comorbidity, based on
prospective data from two population birth cohorts. We highlight two key
findings. Firstly, exposure to cumulative stress is strongly associated
with internalizing symptoms (especially postnatal ELS) and, to a lesser
extent, with adiposity (especially prenatal ELS). Secondly, both pre-
and postnatal stress associate with psycho-cardiometabolic comorbidity
more strongly than to individual health outcomes.

Our first objective was to disentangle the relative contribution of
prenatal and postnatal stress exposure to adolescent internalizing
symptoms and adiposity.

We found that, although both pre- and postnatal ELS contribute to
internalizing symptoms, the impact of postnatal stress is larger and it
is not explained by prenatal confounding, while \textasciitilde60\% of
the prenatal effect was mediated though postnatal stress. This finding
aligns with previous studies investigating the contribution of prenatal
and postnatal exposure to specific stressors (Clayborne et al., 2021;
Plant et al., 2015), and holds promising clinical implications given
that several aspects of the postnatal environment may be modifiable (Yap
et al., 2016). In particular, parental risk factors (such as
psychopathology), direct victimization (e.g., maltreatment) and life
events emerged as independent predictors of internalizing symptoms in
our exploratory analyses, indicating that these may represent important
targets for intervention.

To our knowledge, no study to date has explored such timing effects on
adiposity or related outcomes. Here, we found that \textasciitilde70\%
of the effect of prenatal stress on adiposity was ``direct'' (i.e., not
mediated by postnatal stress); the effect of postnatal stress, both as
mediator and as predictor in the adjusted models, was smaller and
resulted statistically significant only in GenR. While it is important
to note that the effect sizes observed in the adiposity models were
markedly smaller than for internalizing symptoms, these findings provide
some indication that fat accumulation processes could be particularly
vulnerable to (stress-induced) alterations of the prenatal environment.
This is in line with previous theoretical (Barker, 1998; Gluckman et
al., 2008) and empirical (Entringer et al., 2012; Entringer, 2013)
accounts showcasing the impact of stress and stress hormones during
prenatal life on the programming of metabolic function and obesity risk.
In our exploratory follow-up analyses, we additionally found some
evidence that adiposity may be more strongly associated with prenatal
stress in girls, versus postnatal stress in boys. However previous
accounts of these sex differences are mixed (Murphy \& Loria, 2017;
Paternain et al., 2013), and differences in pubertal development may be
an important confounding factor that was not accounted for in our
analysis.

It is also possible that stronger associations between postnatal ELS and
adiposity will emerge later in development. Indeed, accumulating
postnatal risks may influence biological (e.g., inflammatory and
neuro-endocrine) and behavioral factors (e.g., diet and exercise) that
in turn increase physical health burden, but this might become evident
only later in life (Danese \& Tan, 2014; Elsenburg et al., 2017).

Our second aim was to examine whether ELS relates to
psycho-cardiometabolic comorbidity, as suggested by some theoretical
accounts (Juster et al., 2016), but never explicitly investigated
before. If comorbidity was a discrete stress-related pathophysiological
process, then the effect of ELS on comorbidity would differ from the
effect of ELS on mental and physical health separately. This expectation
was partially confirmed by our data: ELS increased the risk of
developing comorbidity compared to being healthy and this estimate was
highest relative to all other groups. However, the overlap between CIs
of the comorbidity and the internalizing-only estimate indicates that
neither pre- nor postnatal stress levels were sufficient to predict
whether a child will develop comorbidity vs.~internalizing problems
alone. Notably, cross-sectional correlations between internalizing and
adiposity at age 13 were small (and so were the comorbidity group
sizes), which may partly explain these findings. However, comorbidity is
known to increase with age (Barnett et al., 2012) and it is possible
that pre- / postnatal stress may serve as better discriminators between
comorbidity and internalizing problems in older samples, with higher
comorbidity rates.

This study has several important strengths. We analysed data from two
large population-based cohorts with remarkably consistent results, which
adds confidence to the robustness and generalizability of our findings.
We used a longitudinal and comprehensive assessment of ELS, enabling us
to quantify the relative contribution of pre- and postnatal exposure to
a broad spectrum of stressors. We focused on two pre-clinical health
markers which manifest in adolescence and may be important targets for
early prevention. Also, the challenge of incomplete data and possible
selection bias was thoroughly addressed by multiple imputation and
sensitivity analyses. However, it is important to note that our measures
of ELS and internalizing symptoms rely primarily on parent reports,
which might have introduced information bias. Further, although several
important confounders were taken into account, it will be important in
the future to examine the role of other potential contributors,
including (epi-)genetic influences (Inoue et al., 2022), pubertal
status, disability/functional impairment and other behavioral factors
(e.g., sleep, exercise, diet).

In conclusion, current approaches to the prevention and management of
depression and obesity have yielded limited success. We believe the
adoption of an integrated, developmental framework is necessary to
improve our understanding and set the stage for better detection and
prevention of these disorders, both in isolation and in their comorbid
form. We provide evidence that both pre- and postnatal ELS associate
with adolescent internalizing symptoms (with prenatal \textless{}
postnatal stress), adiposity (with prenatal \textgreater{} postnatal
stress), and their comorbidity at age 13. While recommendations for how
to best intervene when a higher psychosocial stress burden is identified
are still at embryonic stage, one novel suggestion emerging from our
findings is that prenatal stress may be an underrecognized factor for
identifying children at higher risk of overweight. We would therefore
advice clinicians to enquire about prenatal stress exposure as part of
routine pediatric assessments, so that adequate monitoring and lifestyle
preventative measures can be introduced as early as infancy.

Finally, as we follow these children, it will be informative to see how
these associations evolve over time. For instance, the association
between ELS exposure and adiposity-related outcomes may not emerge fully
until adulthood and it is possible that the nature of the relation
between ELS and comorbidity also differs as a function of developmental
stage.

\markright{Abstract}

\ul{Objective}: Early-life stress (ELS) is an established risk factor
for a host of adult mental and physical health problems, including both
depression and obesity. Recent studies additionally showed that ELS was
associated with an increased risk of comorbidity between mental and
physical health problems, already in adolescence. Healthy lifestyle
factors, including physical activity, sleep and diet have also been
robustly linked to both emotional and physical wellbeing. However, it is
yet unclear whether these lifestyle factors may moderate the association
between ELS and psycho-physical comorbidity.

\ul{Methods}: We investigated whether \emph{(a)} participation in
physical activity, \emph{(b)} sleep duration, and \emph{(c)} adherence
to a Mediterranean diet, moderated the relationship between cumulative
ELS exposure over the first 10 years of life and psycho-physical
comorbidity at the age of 13.5 years. Analyses were conducted in
2022-2023, using data from two large adolescent samples based in the UK
(ALSPAC; n=8428) and The Netherlands (Generation R; n=4268).

\ul{Results}: Exposure to ELS was significantly associated with a higher
risk of developing comorbidity, however this association was not
modified by any of the three lifestyle factors investigated. Only
physical activity was significantly associated with a reduced risk of
comorbidity in one cohort (OR\emph{\(_{ALSPAC}\)} {[}95\%CI{]} = 0.73
{[}0.59; 0.89{]}).

\ul{Conclusions}: In conclusion, while we found some evidence that more
frequent physical activity may be associated with a reduction in
psycho-physical comorbidity, we did not find evidence in support of the
hypothesised moderation effects. However, more research is warranted to
examine how these associations may evolve over time.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}

Over the past few decades, the prevalence of comorbid mental and
physical diseases has risen dramatically, posing a major challenge for
health services across the world (Launders et al., 2022; Ronaldson et
al., 2021). In particular, multiple large studies have shown a
substantial degree of comorbidity between common mood disorders, such as
depression and anxiety, and cardio-metabolic conditions, including
diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease (Fisher et al., 2014; Gold
et al., 2020; Souama et al., 2023). Mounting evidence is further
suggesting an early origin of these psycho-physical comorbidity
patterns, involving shared risk factors and pathophysiological pathways
that begin already in utero (Milaneschi et al., 2019). One of such risk
factors is psychosocial stress -- including for instance family
conflict, financial difficulties or victimization, experienced in the
first years of life -- here collectively defined as early-life stress
(ELS). For example, a recent study conducted in two independent
population-based samples reported that exposure to ELS during gestation
and throughout the first 10 years of life prospectively associated with
increased internalizing symptoms\footnote{Internalizing symptoms
  (Achenbach, 1966) refer to a host of problems, including feelings of
  sadness, withdrawal, anxiety, loneliness or somatic complaints that
  are typical of early manifestations of depression and anxiety during
  childhood and adolescence.}, adiposity, as well as their co-occurrence
in adolescence (Defina et al., 2023). The study focused on broad,
pre-clinical measures of depression/anxiety (i.e.~internalizing
symptoms) and cardio-metabolic risk (i.e.~adiposity) respectively.
However, these associations were also shown to persist into mid- and
late adulthood and manifest into clinical diagnoses (Bright et al.,
2016; Milaneschi et al., 2019; Souama et al., 2023), highlighting the
early developmental origins of these risk pathways.

While these findings certainly support the importance of primary
prevention programmes aimed at reducing the incidence of ELS, preventing
ELS may not always be possible. As such, there is a need to identify
alternative modifiable factors that could mitigate the negative impact
of ELS on later health, and inform the development of complementary
intervention strategies.

Healthy lifestyle factors, including physical activity, sleep and diet
have been robustly linked to both emotional and physical wellbeing
(Briguglio et al., 2020; Firth et al., 2020). For example, regular
physical activity was associated with reduced internalizing (Wheatley et
al., 2020) and depressive symptoms (Oberste et al., 2020), as well as
with lower body mass index (BMI) (Schwarzfischer et al., 2017) in
children and adolescents. Adolescents reporting longer sleep durations
have also been shown to be at lower odds of developing depression and
obesity (Owens et al., 2014). Moreover, diet quality, particularly
adherence to a Mediterranean diet, was associated with reduced
internalizing symptoms (Orlando et al., 2022) and risk of depression
(Shafiei et al., 2023), as well as with lower adiposity (Tognon et al.,
2014) in childhood.

However, it remains unclear whether any of these lifestyle factors could
effectively attenuate the association between ELS exposure and the risk
of comorbidity between mental and physical health problems, in early
adolescence.

To address this gap, we replicated and extended Defina et al.'s (2023)
approach, by investigating the interaction between cumulative ELS
exposure and \emph{(a)} participation in physical activity, \emph{(b)}
sleep duration, and \emph{(c)} adherence to a Mediterranean diet, on
adolescent psycho-physical comorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of
high internalizing symptoms and high adiposity.

\section{Methods}\label{methods-1}

This study follows STROBE guidelines (Elm et al., 2008).

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

Our sample was drawn from two ongoing population-based longitudinal
birth cohorts: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) involving a total of total of 14,833 pregnant women whose
children were born in Avon (UK) between 1991 and 1992 (Boyd et al.,
2012; Fraser et al., 2013); and the Generation R (GenR) Study, involving
9,778 pregnant women, with children born in Rotterdam (the Netherlands)
between 2002 and 2006 (Kooijman et al., 2016). Please note that the

website} contains details of all the data that is available through a
fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool. More detailed
information about ALSPAC study numbers can be found in
\href{https://osf.io/9vky4}{\emph{Supplementary Text S1}}, available
online.

Response rates at the 13 years follow-up were 61\% in ALSPAC and 64\% in
GenR. Participant selection criteria have been previously described
(Defina et al., 2023). In summary, children with more than 50\% missing
ELS items in either the pre- or postnatal period were excluded. All
twins were further excluded and, in the case of non-twin siblings, only
one was retained in the sample. The final sample included 8,428 and
4,268 children in ALSPAC and GenR respectively.

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and
Law Committee, the University of Bath Psychology Research Ethics
Committee (reference number: 20-195), and from the Medical Ethical
Committee of Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam
(MEC-198.782.2001.31).

\subsection{Measures}\label{measures-1}

\subsubsection{Early Life Stress (ELS)
exposure}\label{early-life-stress-els-exposure}

A detailed description of the ELS exposure score can be found elsewhere
{[}Defina et al. (2023);
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/cumulative-ELS-score}{ELS score
repository}{]}. Briefly, a prenatal (i.e., maternal exposure during
pregnancy) and postnatal (i.e.~from birth to 10 years) cumulative ELS
score was constructed in each cohort by combining \textasciitilde100
stress-related items (e.g., death of a relative; financial difficulties;
parental psychopathology; maltreatment or bullying). Prenatal and
postnatal stress scores were then summed to obtain a total ELS exposure
score, spanning from pregnancy to age 10 years.

\subsubsection{Physical and mental health
outcomes}\label{physical-and-mental-health-outcomes}

Following the same approach as Defina et al. (2023), we defined
psycho-physical comorbidity as the co-occurrence of high internalizing
symptoms and high adiposity.

Internalizing symptoms were assessed by parental reports when children
were on average 13.5 years old (range: 12.5-16.8 years) using the
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 1997) in ALSPAC
and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 6-18) (Achenbach, 1999) in GenR.
Both instruments are well-validated reports of emotional and behavioural
functioning referring to the past 6 months, and have been shown to be
comparable (r=0.74) (Goodman \& Scott, 1999).

Adiposity was measured using total body fat mass percentage estimated
via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner (ALSPAC: Lunar
Prodigy DXA scanner, GE Healthcare; GenR: iDXA scanner, GE Healthcare,
Madison, WI) at the average age of 13.5 years (range: 12.5-16.6 years).

Finally, to obtain psycho-physical comorbidity, internalizing symptoms
and fat mass percentage were first dichotomized into high versus
low-moderate, based on a cohort-specific 80th percentile cut-off value.
The dichotomized values were then used to assign children to 4 groups:
``Healthy'' (both outcomes \textless80th percentile); ``High
internalizing'' (internalizing \textgreater80th \& fat mass percentage
≤80th); ``High adiposity'' (internalizing ≤80th \& fat mass percentage
\textgreater80th); and ``Comorbid'' (both outcomes \textgreater80th
percentile). Note that the 80th percentile cut-off was based on previous
validation studies (Achenbach \& Rescorla, 2001; Bourdon et al., 2005;
Flegal et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2014) and the resulting size of the
comorbidity group was larger than expected by chance (permutation test p
\textless{} 0.01; see \href{https://osf.io/xs29c}{\emph{Supplement 2}}
in Defina et al. (2023)).

\subsubsection{Lifestyle factors}\label{lifestyle-factors}

\textbf{\emph{Physical activity}}. Frequency of physical activity was
measured via questionnaires when children were on average 10.7 years old
(range: 10.6-14.7) in ALSPAC and 9.7 years (range: 8.9-12.4) in GenR.
ALSPAC mothers were asked about the ``\emph{Average number of times
their child participated in vigorous physical activity in past month}''
(``\emph{none}'', ``\emph{less than once a week}'', ``\emph{1-3 times a
week}'', ``\emph{4-6 times a week}'' and ``\emph{daily}''), while GenR
children reported ``\emph{How often did they play sports at a sports
club or team}''\,'' (``\emph{once a week}'', ``\emph{2 times a week}'',
``\emph{3 times a week}'', ``\emph{4 times a week}'', or ``\emph{5 or
more times a week}'').

\textbf{\emph{Sleep}}. In the ALSPAC sample, sleep duration (hours) was
calculated using maternal reports of the ``\emph{Time their child
usually goes to sleep and wakes up on normal school days}''\,``,
collected at the mean age of 11.7 years (range: 11.4-13.8).

In GenR, a selected subsample of children {[}N=1,483; Koopman-Verhoeff
et al. (2019){]} completed a sleep diary including questions about the
time they went to bed and woke up, on nine consecutive days (i.e., 5
weekdays and 4 weekend days). These self-reports were used to calculate
average sleep duration across the nine days. Mean age of measurement was
12.7 years (range: 10.4-15.6), however, due to logistical reasons, data
collection was split into two waves, resulting in a 3-years age
difference between the first and second group (i.e., 11 and 14 years;
see Figure~\ref{fig-3.1} B). Sleep duration values measured after either
outcome of interest were set to missing (N=519).

\textbf{\emph{Diet}}. Nutritional intake was assessed at 10.6 years
(range: 9.8-12.2) in ALSPAC and at 8.2 years (range: 7.5-10.8) in GenR,
using a 3-day child-reported food diary (Cribb et al., 2011), and the
4-week parent-reported food frequency questionnaire {[}FFQ; Dutman et
al. (2011){]}, respectively.

ALSPAC participants were asked to record all foods and drinks consumed
over three individual days (preferably one weekend and two weekdays, not
necessarily consecutive), using household measures. The structured diary
was designed for the child to complete with the help of their parents.
They would then bring the diary to the clinic visit where, if possible,
any uncertainties were clarified by a member of the nutrition team. Food
records were transformed into food codes and associated weights using
the DIDO software (Price et al., 1995).

The FFQ consists of 71 food items relevant for the energy intake of
Dutch children (Netherlands Nutrition Centre, 1998). Information on
frequencies, types, and portion sizes was converted into grams of
individual food items per day based on standard Dutch portion sizes
(Velde et al., 2019).

A Mediterranean diet adherence score (ranging from 0 to 7) (Trichopoulou
et al., 2003) was constructed by assigning 1 point for the elevated
(i.e., ≥ median) consumption of five beneficial food groups (i.e.,
vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereal, and fish), and 1 point for
the restricted (i.e., \textless{} median) consumption of two detrimental
food groups (i.e., meat and dairy products). Details of specific items
included in the food groups in each cohort can be found in
\href{https://osf.io/9vky4}{\emph{Supplementary Text S2}}.

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis-1}

Analyses were run separately in the two cohorts, using R version 4.1.0
(R Core Team, 2021) (scripts publicly available
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/lifestyle-moderators-project}{here}).

Missing values in all variables of interest (i.e., exposures, outcomes,
moderators and covariates) were imputed by conditional multiple
imputation (Buuren \& Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) using 60 iterations and
30 imputed datasets (for a complete assessment of missing values and
detailed imputation strategy see
\href{https://osf.io/9vky4}{\emph{Supplementary Text S3}} and
\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary Table S1}}, available
online). Model parameters were fit in each imputed dataset and then
pooled according to Rubin's Rules. To account for multiple comparisons,
false discovery rate correction was applied.

\subsubsection{Main analyses}\label{main-analyses}

To address our primary hypotheses, three multinomial logistic
regressions (i.e., one for each lifestyle factor) were performed, with
psycho-physical risk group as a dependent variable. The reference level
was set to ``healthy''. These models included: \emph{a)} the main effect
of total ELS, \emph{b)} that of each lifestyle factor (separately; i.e.,
physical activity, sleep and diet) and \emph{c)} their interaction, as
well as the full set of covariates. In order to generate meaningful and
comparable estimates for the main effects of interest, both ELS scores
and lifestyle factor variables were standardized using a z
transformation before entering the models. The covariate set included
child sex, age at outcome measure, ethnicity (dichotomized into
``White'' and ``non-White''), maternal smoking and alcohol consumption
during pregnancy and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. To diagnose
multicollinearity between independent variables we computed generalized
variance inflation factors (VIF) for each predictor (James et al.,
2013).

\subsubsection{Follow-up analyses}\label{follow-up-analyses-1}

Several follow-up analyses were conducted, whereby the three main models
(i.e., for physical activity, sleep and diet) were modified to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Feature \emph{(i)} internalizing symptoms and \emph{(ii)} adiposity
  (rather than their comorbidity) as dependent variables (i.e., in two
  separate linear regression models);
\item
  Examine pre-/postnatal ELS (rather than the total ELS score) as main
  stress exposure;
\item
  Assess the effect of adhering to international guidelines regarding
  weekly physical activity, sleep duration and diet, by using a
  dichotomized version of each moderator.We dichotomised the physical
  activity variable according to the WHO recommended guideline for
  vigorous physical activity of ``at least 3 times a week'' for children
  aged 5-17 (Bull et al., 2020). Applied to available response options
  in both cohorts, participation in physical activity was deemed
  ``infrequent'' (0-3 times a week) or ``frequent'' (4+ times a week).
  The sleep variable was dichotomized based on the recommendations of
  the `American Academy of Sleep Medicine' for children aged 6-12 years
  (Paruthi et al., 2016). Children who slept between 9-12 hours were
  categorised as sleeping a ``recommended'' duration, in comparison to
  ``insufficient/excessive'' sleep. Finally, we used a median-split
  approach to dichotomise the diet variable. Children were categorised
  as having lower (≤ median), or higher adherence (\textgreater{}
  median) in each sample.
\end{enumerate}

We additionally explored potential non-linear associations between each
lifestyle factor and the main outcomes of interest by including second-
and third-degree polynomial terms in the models. To assess the extent to
which maternal health and lifestyle behaviour may have moderated the
relationships of interest (Epstein et al., 2023; Heslehurst et al.,
2019), we further investigated the interaction between ELS and maternal
BMI on child comorbidity. Finally, to assess the impact of the
imputation procedure on our results, we ran the analyses in the
subsample with complete moderator and outcome data.

\section{Results}\label{results-1}

\subsection{Sample characteristics}\label{sample-characteristics}

Sample characteristics were pooled across imputed datasets and
summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-3.1}. Briefly, the ALSPAC sample included
8,428 (48\% male) children, whose mothers were 96\% White and 30\%
highly educated (i.e., held a college or university degree). The GenR
sample included 4,268 (52\% male) participants, 71\% of which were
encoded as ``White'' (i.e., European, North American, Japanese or
Indonesian) and 14\% had highly educated (i.e., ``higher, phase 2'')
mothers. The distribution of each lifestyle factor and their
correlations are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig-3.1}. The proportion of
children categorized as comorbid was small (2.9\% in ALSPAC and 5.1\% in
GenR), as also reflected by the weak correlations between internalizing
scores and adiposity (r = ALSPAC: 0.10; GenR: 0.12; see
\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary Table S2}}).

\subsection{Main analyses}\label{main-analyses-1}

We did not find evidence in support of any of the hypothesised
moderation effects (\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary
Table S3}}). Increased ELS was significantly associated with higher risk
of developing comorbidity (vs.~being healthy; Figure~\ref{fig-3.2} A;
ORs: 1.65-1.67 in ALSPAC and 2.70-2.75 in GenR), but this association
was not modified by any of the three lifestyle factors we investigated
(Figure~\ref{fig-3.2} B-D).

Conversely, while comorbidity risk was generally lower in children who
engaged in favourable lifestyle behaviours (Figure~\ref{fig-3.2} A),
this effect was only significant for physical activity and only in one
of the two cohorts (OR\emph{\(_{ALSPAC}\)} {[}95\%CI{]} = 0.73
{[}0.59;0.89{]}). The magnitude of multicollinearity was low in all the
models (VIF ≤ 1.17; see \href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary
Table S3}}).

interaction between ELS and physical activity, sleep or diet.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Follow-up analyses}\label{follow-up-analyses-2}

When internalizing symptoms and adiposity were examined as two separate
outcomes, a similar pattern of results emerged
(\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary Table S4}};
Figure~\ref{fig-3.3}). ELS was significantly associated with increased
internalizing symptoms and adiposity, but neither association was
modified by physical activity, sleep or diet.

Only the main effect of physical activity on internalizing symptoms was
statistically significant in both cohorts (β\emph{\(_{ALSPAC}\)}
{[}95\%CI{]} = -0.05 {[}-0.08;-0.03{]}; β\emph{\(_{GenR}\)} {[}95\%CI{]}
= -0.05 {[}-0.09;-0.02{]}).

Engagement in two of the three favourable lifestyle behaviours was
linked to lower adiposity levels, but only in one of the two cohorts
(β\emph{\(_{ALSPAC}\)} {[}95\%CI{]}: physical activity = -0.08
{[}-0.10;-0.06{]}; sleep = -0.02 {[}-0.05;0.01{]}).

Findings did not change substantially when ELS exposure was restricted
to the prenatal or postnatal periods only
(\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary Table S5}}), nor when
lifestyle factors were dichotomized into adherence and non-adherence to
international guidelines
(\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary Table S6}}). The
non-linear relationships between each lifestyle factor and the main
outcomes of interest are represented in
\href{https://osf.io/9vky4}{\emph{Supplementary Figure S1}}. Only for
the relationship between sleep and internalizing symptoms did we find
any evidence for a non-linear (inverse logarithmic) trend. We did not
find a statistically significant interaction between ELS exposure and
maternal BMI on child comorbidity
(\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary Table S7}}). The
sensitivity analysis conducted in the subsample with complete outcome
and moderator data (sample size = ALSPAC: 3680-4237; GenR: 961-2369)
also did not impact our main conclusions
(\href{https://osf.io/x9g6b}{\emph{Supplementary Table S8}}).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}

In this study based on data from two independent population-based
cohorts, we did not find evidence that either physical activity, sleep
or dietary behaviour may attenuate the association between ELS exposure
and adolescent psycho-physical comorbidity.

However, at average levels of stress exposure, engaging in more frequent
physical activity (more so than sleeping adequately or following a
Mediterranean diet) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of
developing comorbidity, as well as with lower levels of both
internalizing symptoms and adiposity, in one of the cohorts
investigated. While the direction of effects was generally consistent
across cohorts, only the association between physical activity and
internalizing symptoms resulted statistically significant in both ALSPAC
and GenR children. Overall, it is important to note that the association
between lifestyle behaviours and psycho-physical comorbidity was
considerably smaller compared to that between ELS and comorbidity.

In line with these findings, previous studies conducted in adult
populations also showed how the association between retrospectively
reported childhood maltreatment and higher odds of psycho-physical
comorbidity, was still present after additional adjustment for
concurrent lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use, sleep and
physical activity (Souama et al., 2023; Tomasdottir et al., 2015),
although none of these previous studies formally tested for
ELS-by-lifestyle interactions.

Our results also align with the previously reported protective effects
of physical activity (e.g., swimming or cycling) for reducing the risk
of depression (Choi et al., 2019, 2020; Firth et al., 2020; He et al.,
2021; Schuch et al., 2018), although this was not specific to children
exposed to higher levels of stress (Choi et al., 2020).

In contrast, we could not find convincing evidence that either longer
sleep duration or improved diet quality would alleviate the risk for
depression or cardiometabolic problems (or their combination), as
suggested by some previous studies (He et al., 2021; Katikireddi et al.,
2017; Lassale et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2015). Developmental timing and
/ or differences in outcome measurement may have played a role in
explaining this discrepancy. It is possible, for example, that engaging
in healthy lifestyle behaviours later in life may be more beneficial, or
that the protective effects of childhood lifestyle behaviours may
manifest only later in adulthood. It is also possible that the
associations reported in the adult literature may be biased through
reverse causation {[}e.g., depression being a causal risk factor for
poor diet and sleep; Choi et al. (2020){]}.

One further insight emerging from these analyses was that of a stronger
magnitude of association between ELS and comorbidity compared to that
between each of the three lifestyle factors and comorbidity. While this
result could be interpreted as an indication of the more severe,
long-lasting impact of ELS, as discussed elsewhere (Henchoz et al.,
2019; Souama et al., 2023; Tomasdottir et al., 2015), we would like to
highlight that differential measurement error could have played a role
in explaining this finding. Indeed, our ELS measure was considerably
more comprehensive (i.e., comprised of many more items and covering a
longer time period) compared to each of the lifestyle factors, which
were only assessed at a single time point and based on fewer indicators.
It is possible, for example, that the hypothesized moderation effects
may emerge when a more long-term engagement in physical activity is
considered.

In addition to this point, a few other study limitations need to be
considered when interpreting these results. First, our measurement of
ELS, lifestyle behaviours and internalizing symptoms rely primarily on
parent reports, which might have introduced information bias. ELS
exposure was assessed over a large (\textasciitilde10 years) temporal
window, but the measure was inevitably constrained by data availability.
Additionally, cohort differences in the reporting of physical activity
(i.e., ``vigorous physical activity'' in ALSPAC, vs.~``sports'' in GenR)
may have contributed to heterogeneous findings for the main effect of
physical activity on comorbidity. For example, ``sports'' can include
non-vigorous activities, which are potentially less effective in
reducing depressive symptoms (Oberste et al., 2020). Second, while we
focused here on three lifestyle markers that are most relevant to the
developmental period of interest and may constitute important targets
for early prevention, other potentially relevant factors such as
smoking, alcohol use or psychological coping strategies, are also likely
to be of relevance (Hanlon et al., 2020; Skou et al., 2022) and should
be taken into account in future studies. Further, although we adjusted
our analyses for several important confounders and we addressed the
challenge of selection bias thoroughly by multiple imputation and
sensitivity analyses, we cannot exclude the possibility that residual
sampling bias and/or other unmeasured factors (e.g., pubertal status or
(epi-)genetic influences) may have influenced our results. For instance,
the majority of the children included in our samples were of European
descent, and these findings may not be generalizable to different
populations. Furthermore, shared biological risk factors for depression
and obesity (e.g.~dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis, chronic inflammation, or microbiome dysbiosis; (Milaneschi et al.,
2019) could potentially mediate the effect of ELS on psycho-physical
comorbidity. Finally, our study focused on one aspect of adolescent
mental health, i.e.~internalizing symptoms, that is most predictive of
future depression/anxiety problems. However, other measures of
adolescent behaviour, e.g., externalizing problems, could represent
interesting targets for future studies in the field.

In conclusion, several international guidelines and policies already
acknowledge the importance of lifestyle interventions not only for the
obesity and poor cardiovascular health crisis, but also with respect to
their protective effects against poor mental health (Australian
Department of Health, 2014; D. of Health \& Social Care, 2011; N. I. for
Health \& Care Excellence, 2015; Stubbs et al., 2018; Tremblay et al.,
2016). Although the current study reports a lack of influence from
lifestyle factors, a non-significant interaction should not be
interpreted as evidence that adopting a healthy lifestyle is ineffective
in mitigating the detrimental consequences of ELS on comorbid
internalizing and adiposity in childhood. Instead, our study further
emphasizes the need for the investigation of early comorbidity
prevention strategies that target children who have experienced ELS, and
that more research is warranted to examine the potential moderating
effects of a wider range of lifestyle behaviours. 

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Our study could not detect convincing evidence in support of the
hypothesis that the detrimental effects of ELS on psycho-physical
comorbidity risk may be attenuated by adopting healthier lifestyle
habits in childhood. We found some suggestive evidence that engaging in
more frequent physical activity may reduce the risk for comorbidity,
irrespective of stress exposure levels. If confirmed in future studies,
this set of findings could highlight the need for more comorbidity
prevention efforts focused on reducing ELS, in addition to current
intervention programmes that focus on lifestyle behaviours such as
physical activity.

\markright{Abstract}

\ul{Background}: Depressive symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors
often co-occur. However, our understanding of the potential mechanisms
and temporal dynamics underlying their co-development remains elusive.

\ul{Methods}: This population-based cohort study examined bidirectional
longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and
cardio-metabolic risk factors from age 10 to 25 years, using prospective
data from the ALSPAC Study. Participants with at least one (of six)
follow-up measurement for each outcome were included in the analyses. We
measured depressive symptoms through self- as well as parent-reports,
and assessed several cardio-metabolic risk factors (including adiposity
measures, lipid profiles and inflammation).

\ul{Results}: Among our 7970 (47\% male, 96\% White) participants, we
found bidirectional, within-person associations between self-reported
depressive symptoms and adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass index, but not
body mass index), across the study period. Adiposity was more stable
over time (\emph{β} {[}range{]} = 0.75 {[}0.54; 0.84{]}), compared to
depressive symptoms (0.26 {[}0.12; 0.38{]}), and it had a stronger
prospective (i.e., cross-lagged) association with future depressive
symptoms (0.07 {[}0.03, 0.13{]}) compared to that between depressive
symptom and future adiposity (0.04 {[}0.03, 0.06{]}). The magnitude of
these associations reached its peak between 14 and 16 years. We did not
find evidence of cross-lagged associations in either direction between
depressive symptoms and waist circumference, insulin, triglycerides, LDL
cholesterol or C-reactive protein.

\ul{Conclusions}: These findings suggest a bidirectional relationship
between depressive symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors,
particularly adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass). Adiposity showed a
stronger prospective association with future depressive symptoms, than
vice versa, however their relationship revealed more reciprocal than
previously thought.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-4}

Over 20\% of the general population faces at least one depressive
episode in their lifetime (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al., 2020) and a growing
number of adolescents experience depressive symptoms before the age of
20 years (Keeley, 2021; Patalay \& Gage, 2019). Concurrently, the
prevalence of child obesity and related cardio-metabolic risk factors is
alarmingly high, affecting one in three children and almost half of
young adults (NCD-RisC, 2017; WHO, 2022). Moreover, depressive symptoms
and cardio-metabolic risk factors often co-occur (Anwar et al., 2018;
Blasco et al., 2020; Gutiérrez-Rojas et al., 2020). For example, a large
meta-analysis showed that people suffering from depression had a 58\%
higher risk of developing obesity, while individuals with obesity had a
55\% elevated risk of developing depression, compared to the general
population (Luppino et al., 2010).

Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observed
comorbidity, both in adults (Carey et al., 2014; Milaneschi et al.,
2019) and children (Defina et al., 2023; Sutaria et al., 2019). However,
scientific efforts to empirically model the co-developmental processes
that may underlie this comorbidity (i.e., temporal precedence and/or
bidirectional relationships) have been sparse, inconsistent, and mostly
focused on adult or aging populations (Forman-Hoffman et al., 2007;
Konttinen et al., 2014) and/or genetic liabilities (Chen et al., 2023;
Jokela \& Laakasuo, 2023).

In the pediatric literature, a small number of studies have investigated
longitudinal relationships between body mass index (BMI) and
internalizing / emotional problems (an early marker of depressive
symptoms) (Bradley et al., 2008; Jansen et al., 2013; Patalay \&
Hardman, 2019; Zhou et al., 2022). The majority of these studies found
higher BMI to precede increases in internalizing symptoms, but not the
other way around (Bradley et al., 2008; Jansen et al., 2013; Patalay \&
Hardman, 2019), in line with some (but not all, e.g. Chen et al. (2023))
Mendelian randomization studies investigating the causal effect of
obesity on depression (Jokela \& Laakasuo, 2023). A more recent
investigation however, did identify reciprocal relationships between BMI
and internalizing symptoms, by employing more advanced modeling
frameworks, capable of decomposing between- and within-person variances
over time (Zhou et al., 2022).

Importantly, while changes in fat mass are hypothesized to be a key
mechanism in these studies, they rely exclusively on BMI measures, which
cannot discriminate between fat mass and lean (e.g.~muscle) mass, and
are thus a suboptimal measure of cardio-metabolic risk (Dencker et al.,
2007; Liu et al., 2013; Vanderwall et al., 2017). Moreover, existing
evidence largely relies on parental reports of depressive symptoms,
which may be less sensitive compared to self-reports (Cohen et al.,
2019). Finally, these studies only investigated relatively short
follow-up periods and early developmental windows (i.e., 1 to 5 years,
from childhood to early adolescence), leaving the period between
adolescence to young adulthood, which is when these conditions typically
find their onset, largely unexplored.

To address these gaps, we aimed to characterize the temporal dynamics
underlying the (co-)development of depressive symptoms and
cardio-metabolic risk as they unfold jointly across 15 years, from the
age of 10 to 25 years. We investigated several cardio-metabolic risk
factors (including total fat and lean mass) and multi-informant reports
on depressive symptoms.

In the spirit of open science, we also provide an open-source
interactive web-application that can be used, alongside this article, to
flexibly explore our results and verify their robustness across multiple
outcomes and analytical choices.

\section{Methods}\label{methods-4}

\subsection{Sample and measures}\label{sample-and-measures}

This study is based on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children (ALSPAC). Pregnant women resident in Avon (UK) with
expected delivery dates between 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992
were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of
pregnancies enrolled was 14,541, with 13,988 children who were alive at
1 year of age. When children were approximately 7 years old, additional
eligible cases were re-invited, resulting in a total sample of 15,447
pregnancies and 14,901 children who were alive at 1 year of age (Boyd et
al., 2012; Fraser et al., 2013; Northstone et al., 2019). Study data
were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools
hosted at the University of Bristol (Harris et al., 2009). Please note
that the ALSPAC website contains details of all the data that is
available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search
tool (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/).

\subsubsection{Ethical considerations}\label{ethical-considerations}

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and
Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. Informed consent
was obtained from participants' parents.

\subsubsection{Depressive symptoms}\label{depressive-symptoms}

Depressive symptoms were repeatedly measured using the Short Mood and
Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) (Angold et al., 1995; Kwong, 2019). The
instrument includes 13 items referred to the past two weeks and scored
between 0--2 (i.e., \emph{``not true''} / \emph{``sometimes true''} /
\emph{``true''}). A summary score ranging between 0--26 was computed at
each occasion, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms
(Figure~\ref{fig-6.1} A). The SMFQ was administered to the child/young
person on six occasions between the ages of 10 and 25 years (at the
median ages of 10.6, 12.8, 13.8, 16.6, 17.8, and 23.8 years). The
questionnaire was also completed by participants' parents (most commonly
mothers) on four additional occasions (when children were on average
9.6, 11.7, 31.1, and 16.7 years old) which were used in secondary
analyses.

\subsubsection{Cardio-metabolic risk
markers}\label{cardio-metabolic-risk-markers}

The primary cardio-metabolic measure examined in this study was fat mass
index (FMI; Figure~\ref{fig-6.1} B), computed as participants' total
body fat mass divided by their squared height (kg/m2). Total body fat
mass was derived from whole body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
scans at six occasions (at median ages of 9.8, 11.8, 13.8, 15.4, 17.8,
and 24.5 years) (Dangardt et al., 2019).

Ten other cardio-metabolic risk factors were further examined in
secondary analyses, including lean mass index (LMI), body mass index
(BMI), waist circumference, android fat mass, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels,
triglycerides, insulin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) (see
\href{https://osf.io/wyzd8}{\emph{Appendix S1}},
\href{https://osf.io/wyzd8}{\emph{Figure S1}}.

\subsubsection{Sample demographics}\label{sample-demographics}

Participant sex was measured at birth. Participants' parents further
reported on their ethnical identity (at recruitment) and their
educational attainment (when children were 5 years old).

\subsection{Statistical analyses}\label{statistical-analyses}

Analyses were conducted using R version 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2021); model
specification and fit was implemented in lavaan (version 0.6--16)
(Rosseel, 2012). All scripts are publicly available
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/comorb-longit-project}{here}.

\subsubsection{Data pre-processing}\label{data-pre-processing}

To ensure optimal model conversion, we first performed data cleaning by
setting extreme outlier values (i.e., \textgreater{} 5 interquartile
ranges above the third quartile or below the first quartile) to missing.
We then transformed the data to reduce skewness, using a square root
transformation (for depressive symptoms scores; see Figure~\ref{fig-6.1}
A) or a ln transformation (for cardio-metabolic risk markers; see
Figure~\ref{fig-6.1} B). Finally, we performed min-max normalization
(see Equation~\ref{eq-normalization}) to rescale of all variables to a
{[}0, 1{]} range.
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-normalization}{ 
x_{norm} = \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)} 
}\end{equation}

This procedure allowed us to obtain comparable estimates across
different units and improve model convergence, while preserving relative
differences within each variable over time (e.g.~mean variations).

\subsubsection{Main analyses}\label{main-analyses-2}

We fit a lag-1 random-intercept cross-lag panel model (RI-CLPM) (Hamaker
et al., 2015) to characterize the relationship between self-reported
depressive symptoms and fat mass index across 6 time points
(\textasciitilde10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 years). The model was
specified as a structural equation model composed of four parts (see
also
\href{https://osf.io/wyzd8,\%20\%5B*Figure\%20S2*\%5D(https://osf.io/wyzd8)}{\emph{Appendix
S2}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A between-person part, consisting of the ``random intercepts''
  (\(η_{\ dep}\) and \(η_{\ FMI}\)). These are latent variables that
  have each measurement occasion as indicator and factor loadings set to
  1. They reflect stable (i.e., ``time-invariant'') between-person
  differences (e.g., some children may have systematically higher fat
  mass over time compared to others).
\item
  A within-person part, consisting of ``within-unit fluctuations'':
  time-specific residual terms specified as latent variables with factor
  loading set to 1, and (measurement error) variances set to 0. They
  represent random changes that make observations unique, allowing
  individuals to differ (from themselves) at each occasion. For example,
  these could reflect a life event that raises/lowers a person's
  depression at a given time \(t\).
\item
  The (lag-1) regressions between the within-unit components: i.e.~the
  auto-regressive and cross-lagged terms.

  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    auto-regressive terms quantify the persistence (or ``inertia'') of a
    construct, i.e.~its tendency to retain its state over time. For
    example, AR\textasciitilde* dep*\textasciitilde{} captures the
    proportion of past depression that persists directly to the next
    measurement occasion.
  \item
    In contrast, cross-lagged relations measure the proportion of past
    variance in one variable that is reflected in the other variable at
    the next measurement occasion, and are therefore used to infer
    (Granger) causality. For example, CL\textasciitilde*
    dep*\textasciitilde{} indicates how much within-person variance in
    depression at time \(t\) is uniquely explained by FMI at time point
    \(t\) -- 1 (controlling for the persistence of past values of
    depression).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Covariances in the between- and within- person part.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To control for between-person trends that may confound the
    (within-person) system dynamics reflected by auto-regressive and
    cross-lagged terms, the covariance between \(η_{\ dep}\) and
    \(η_{\ FMI}\) is freely estimated.
  \item
    Similarly, because within-unit fluctuations may be non-independent
    (e.g., when a random change affects both variables simultaneously)
    this is modelled by estimating their covariance within each wave.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation was used to
account for missing patterns that may not conform to MCAR. Coefficients
were standardized and conventional robust standard errors were used to
compute 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI).

Model fit was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation (RMSEA), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis
Index (TLI), and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). We
considered model fit to be adequate when: RMSEA ≤ 0.05, CFI and TLI ≥
0.95, and SRMR \textless{} 0.08 (Kline, 2016).

\subsubsection{Exploratory analyses}\label{exploratory-analyses}

We further conducted three sets of exploratory follow-up analyses.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  We replaced FMI with each of 10 alternative cardio-metabolic risk
  markers, including measures of adiposity (i.e., BMI, LMI, android fat
  mass and waist circumference), lipid profiles (i.e., HDL and LDL
  cholesterol levels, and triglycerides), insulin levels and
  inflammation (i.e., CRP).
\item
  We replaced self-reported depressive symptoms scores with maternal
  reports (at the available time points).
\item
  Estimated an Autoregressive Latent Trajectory Model with Structured
  Residuals (ALT-SR) with linear latent growth as an alternative to the
  RI-CLPM. Briefly, the ALT-SR is a more flexible modelling approach,
  which allows to explicitly model developmental trends (i.e.~latent
  random slopes), in addition to the stable trait-like between-person
  differences (i.e., latent random intercepts) (Curran et al., 2014).
\end{enumerate}

Note that the project
\href{https://longit-comorbidity.onrender.com}{web-application} offers
the opportunity for researchers to interact with model settings and
examine the robustness of findings against violations of modelling
assumptions, such as the temporal stability of the between- and
within-person components (\href{https://osf.io/wyzd8}{\emph{Appendix
S2}}).

\section{Results}\label{results-2}

\subsection{Descriptive statistics}\label{descriptive-statistics}

Sample descriptives are presented in Table~\ref{tbl-6.1} and
Figure~\ref{fig-6.1}. The main analytical sample consisted of 7970 (47\%
male) participants, who had at least one measurement of depressive
symptoms and FMI; 96\% of participants' parents identified as ethnically
``White''.

Both depressive symptoms and FMI increased slightly with age (see
Figure~\ref{fig-6.1} A-B); their cross-sectional correlations ranged
from 0.00 to 0.17 (r mean = 0.10; Figure~\ref{fig-6.1} C).

Girls had systematically higher FMI compared to boys across time points,
and they reported higher depressive symptoms scores from the ages of 14
years onwards.

\subsection{Main results}\label{main-results}

Results of the main analyses, examining the co-development of depressive
symptoms and FMI, are summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-6.2} and
Figure~\ref{fig-6.2}. The model showed good fit (\(χ^2\)(37) = 356.77,
\emph{p}\textless0.001; RMSEA {[}95\%CI{]} = 0.033 {[}0.030-0.036{]};
CFI = 0.991; TLI = 0.983; SRMR = 0.027).

We found positive auto-regressive associations, indicating substantial
within-person stability over time in FMI (mean \(β\) {[}range{]} = 0.75
{[}0.54; 0.84{]}, SE = 0.016) and, to a lower extent, in depressive
symptoms (\(β\) {[}range{]} = 0.26 {[}0.12; 0.38{]}, SE = 0.022).

After accounting for within-person (i.e., autoregressive associations)
and between-person stability (i.e., random intercepts), the following
within-person cross-lag dynamics emerged from our models
(Table~\ref{tbl-6.2}): higher FMI was associated with increased
subsequent depressive symptoms across the study period, except between
12 and 14 years (\(β\) {[}range{]} = 0.07 {[}0.03, 0.13{]}, SE = 0.030);
higher depressive symptoms were associated with increased subsequent
FMI, although these associations were weaker on average, compared to
those between FMI and future depressive symptoms (\(β\) {[}range{]} =
0.04 {[}0.03, 0.06{]}, SE = 0.01).

\subsection{Exploratory analysis
results}\label{exploratory-analysis-results}

Please visit the project
\href{https://longit-comorbidity.onrender.com}{web-application} for an
interactive report of all results obtained from exploratory analyses. We
highlight and summarize below a few key findings.

\subsubsection{Other cardio-metabolic risk
factors}\label{other-cardio-metabolic-risk-factors}

The pattern of reciprocal cross-lag paths identified in the main
analysis was remarkably consistent when lean mass (rather than fat mass)
index was examined as a cardio-metabolic risk factor (average
standardized \(β\) for LMI to depressive symptoms = -0.08, SE = 0.029;
depressive symptoms to LMI = -0.04, SE = 0.007). When BMI was included
in the model instead, only the prospective association between BMI and
depressive symptoms remained (\(β\) = 0.05, SE = 0.035), while
depressive symptoms did not seem to affect future BMI (\(β\) \textless{}
0.01, SE = 0.008). Android fat mass and depressive symptoms showed
reciprocal associations only between 14 and 16 years (android fat to
depressive symptoms = 0.14 {[}0.06; 0.21{]}; depressive symptoms to
android fat = 0.04 {[}0.01; 0.07{]}).

Surprisingly, a positive within-person reciprocal association between
depressive symptoms and HDL (but not LDL) cholesterol levels was
detected, between 16 and 25 years (see Figure~\ref{fig-6.3}). In
contrast, the correlation between the random intercepts of depressive
symptoms and HDL cholesterol was negative (-0.18 {[}-0.27; -0.09{]}). We
did not find evidence of direct associations in either direction when
waist circumference, insulin, triglycerides, or CRP were considered in
relation to self-reported depressive symptoms; however, a stable
between-person association was detected for waist circumference (0.10
{[}0.04; 0.15{]}), insulin (0.12 {[}0.01; 0.23{]}) and CRP (0.11
{[}0.01; 0.20{]}).

\subsubsection{Maternal reports of depressive
symptoms}\label{maternal-reports-of-depressive-symptoms}

The reported findings were relatively consistent (albeit weaker) when
maternal reports of depressive symptoms were used in place of
self-reports (average standardized βs for FMI to depressive symptoms =
0.09, SE = 0.041; depressive symptoms to FMI = 0.04, SE = 0.013; see
Figure S3). Please visit the project
\href{https://longit-comorbidity.onrender.com}{web-application} for a
complete report of these findings.

associations (and their 95\% confidence intervals) are presented along
the x-axis, for each alternative cardio-metabolic risk factor, listed on
the y-axis. The temporal lag each estimate refers to is specified in
years on the y-axis. Association estimates from cardio-metabolic risk
factor to lagged depressive symptoms are presented in yellow on the left
and those between depressive symptoms and lagged cardio-metabolic risk
factor are shown in purple on the right. In the last column on the right
of the graphs, the estimated correlation coefficient between the random
intercepts of each construct (and its 95\% confidence interval) is
reported.}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Alternative modelling approaches: the ALT-SR
model}\label{alternative-modelling-approaches-the-alt-sr-model}

The results of exploratory models including random slopes are discussed
in the supplement (\href{https://osf.io/wyzd8}{\emph{Appendix S3}} and
\href{https://osf.io/wyzd8}{\emph{Figure S4}}). We highlight here only a
few key findings. When between-person differences in developmental
(linear) trends were considered in the model, a slightly different
pattern of CL relationships emerged. In particular, the CL effects of
fat / lean mass on later depression no longer peaked between 13-15 years
but rather kept increasing linearly over time for the duration of
follow-up (see \href{https://osf.io/wyzd8}{\emph{Figure S4}}).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-4}

In this population-based study, we characterized the between- and
within-person associations governing the co-development of depressive
symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors, from age 10 to 25 years.
Specifically, we found bidirectional, within-person associations between
depressive symptoms and adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass index, but not
body mass index). Adiposity was more stable over time, compared to
depressive symptoms, and it had a stronger prospective association with
future depressive symptoms compared to that between depressive symptom
and future adiposity.

\subsection{The co-development of depressive symptoms and adiposity: fat
vs.~weight
measures}\label{the-co-development-of-depressive-symptoms-and-adiposity-fat-vs.-weight-measures}

Interestingly, the pattern of reciprocal associations between depressive
symptoms and adiposity was only evident when using fat and lean mass
measures, not BMI. The prospective relationship between earlier
depressive symptoms and later BMI was not detectable, similar to what
has been reported in previous genetic (Jokela \& Laakasuo, 2023) and
longitudinal epidemiological studies conducted in children (Bradley et
al., 2008; Jansen et al., 2013; Patalay \& Hardman, 2019).

This is important because, despite its popularity, BMI is not the best
indicator of cardio-metabolic risk (e.g., a high BMI may also reflect
high muscle mass, and a normal BMI does not exclude a high body fat
percentage) (Liu et al., 2013). Compared to fat-based measures, BMI was
also a weaker predictor of depressive symptoms (as well as other
physical heath complications) in older adults (Fulton et al., 2022;
Hryhorczuk et al., 2013; Milaneschi et al., 2019; Weber-Hamann et al.,
2006).

Based on this evidence, we recommend the use of fat or lean mass
measures when assessing the relationship between adiposity and
depressive symptoms, as relying on BMI only may lead the erroneous
conclusion that increased adiposity is only an antecedent (rather than a
consequence) of early-onset depressive symptoms.

\subsection{Maternal- vs.~self-reports of depressive
symptoms}\label{maternal--vs.-self-reports-of-depressive-symptoms}

We found a generally similar pattern of relationships between depressive
symptoms and adiposity, when using maternal reports of depressive
symptoms (rather than self-reports). However, associations were weaker
when using maternal reports and they were less consistent across time
points. Previous studies have relied solely on maternal reports when
investigating relationships with child adiposity, which may have further
contributed to inconsistencies in the reported timing, direction, and
magnitude of these associations.

\subsection{The wheels of a ``vicious cycle''? reciprocal influences
vs.~stable
differences}\label{the-wheels-of-a-vicious-cycle-reciprocal-influences-vs.-stable-differences}

Several potential mechanisms could modulate and/or explain the
bidirectional within-person dynamics highlighted in this study. For
example, higher adiposity may affect psychological well-being, through
reduced self-esteem, and increased feelings of shame, isolation, and
body image dissatisfaction (Sjöberg et al., 2005), especially during
adolescence. Adipose tissue is also an endocrine organ, involved in the
production of oestrogen and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Kyrou et
al., 2006). These cytokines contribute to chronic low-grade systemic
inflammation, which has been implicated in the development of common
depressive symptoms such as anhedonia, fatigue, concentration problems
and social withdrawal (Slavich \& Irwin, 2014). In turn, depressive
symptoms may increase the risk for subsequent adiposity through
increased sedentary behavior, reduced sleep quality (Haarasilta et al.,
2004), and the adoption of poorer (e.g., pro-inflammatory) dietary
patterns (Lassale et al., 2019).

Interestingly, in addition to these within-person associations (which
are directional and time-specific) we also found some stable
between-person associations between depressive symptoms and adiposity.
This is an indication that a consistent portion of the comorbidity
burden can be better explained by ``shared risk factors'' that are
largely time-invariant (e.g., sex, genetic liability, or residual
confounders such as parenting practices), rather than by the reciprocal
influence between constructs.

\subsection{Depressive symptoms and chronic
inflammation}\label{depressive-symptoms-and-chronic-inflammation}

The relationship between depressive symptoms and CRP, for instance, was
better characterised in our dataset by a stable between-person
association (i.e.~people with higher depressive symptoms tend to also
have higher CRP levels) rather than by a system of direct reciprocal
influences (i.e.~higher CRP leading to increased depressive symptoms at
the next measurement occasion, or vice versa).

\subsection{Depressive symptoms and lipid
profiles}\label{depressive-symptoms-and-lipid-profiles}

With respect to lipid profiles, a similar relationship pattern emerged
between depressive symptoms and insulin levels (i.e., no reciprocal
effects but rather a stable between-person association). We also
detected interesting differences in the between- vs.~within-person
relationships between depressive symptoms and HDL cholesterol. Indeed,
while the between-person correlation between random intercepts was
negative (i.e., higher depressive symptoms -- lower HDL cholesterol), as
expected based on previous research (Penninx et al., 2013), we found
positive (reciprocal) within-person associations (i.e., higher
depressive symptoms were prospectively related to higher HDL cholesterol
and vice versa). While similar associations have been reported before
(Jia et al., 2020; Khalfan et al., 2023; Shin et al., 2008), this
finding was somewhat surprising, and it should be interpreted with
caution. Similarly, associations between depressive symptoms and higher
LDL cholesterol and triglycerides have been reported in the literature,
but rather inconsistently, and mostly in older and / or clinical
populations (Ashwin et al., 2024; Khalfan et al., 2023; Shin et al.,
2008).

While the biological pathways connecting depression and lipid profile
abnormalities remain far from clear, it has been proposed that lower
cholesterol may reduce serotonin receptor exposure, impairing mood
regulation (Ashwin et al., 2024). Additionally, chronic stress and
cortisol imbalances (i.e.~HPA axis dysregulation) often reported in
depressed individuals may alter lipid metabolism, contributing to both
low and high lipid levels (Ashwin et al., 2024).

\subsection{Strengths, limitations and future
directions}\label{strengths-limitations-and-future-directions}

This is one of the very few studies capable of testing bidirectional
(prospective) relationships between depressive symptoms and
cardio-metabolic risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first to investigate them across such an extended developmental period.
We highlighted associations with a host of cardio-metabolic risk factors
(including weight- and fat-based measures of adiposity, lipid profiles
and inflammatory markers), and multi-informant reports of depressive
symptoms. We documented both between- and within-person relationships,
which were not necessarily consistent with each other (Berry \&
Willoughby, 2017) (as in the case of HDL cholesterol) and have separate
implications for both mechanistic (i.e., causal) interpretations and
clinical recommendations for prevention and/or intervention efforts.
Finally, we provide an open-access web-application that allows
researchers to explore and verify the robustness of our results.

However, these findings should be interpreted in light of some important
limitations.

First, because the repeated measures leveraged by our models were
collected every 1 to 6 years, these results are only informative about
processes/dynamics that take place on this temporal scale. Higher
temporal granularity, e.g., monthly assessments, may be needed to
confirm, further refine or disprove these findings. For example, the
smaller association between depressive symptoms and future adiposity,
compared to that between adiposity and future depressive symptoms, could
be due partly (or entirely) to inherent differences in the fluctuation
of depressive mood vs.~the persistence of adiposity over several years.
Likewise, the lack of reciprocal prospective associations between
depressive symptoms and the other markers of cardio-metabolic heath
investigated here (including lipid profiles and systemic inflammation
markers) could be explained by the transient nature of these measures.
For example CRP is known to have a very short half-life
(\textasciitilde19 hours), reflecting acute rather than chronic
inflammatory processes (Mouliou, 2023).

Second, while the inclusion of random intercepts can help reduce bias,
e.g., by controlling for direct and indirect confounding effects from
multiple sources (Murayama \& Gfrörer, 2024), we cannot completely
eliminate such bias. For example, our models do not adequately handle
either non-linear nor time-varying effects of time-invariant
confounders, potentially failing to account for critical biological and
environmental factors at play. For example, both depressive symptoms and
adiposity have been linked with endocrine processes, which are
particularly salient during puberty. Moreover, similar to most prior
studies, the findings presented here are based on an ethnically
homogeneous sample of ``White'' children from the UK, and may not be
generalisable to other ethnic (or national) groups. Finally, depression
is a very heterogeneous condition, characterized by distinct symptom
clusters (e.g., vegetative symptoms such as fatigue and appetite
changes, but also affective, cognitive, and somatic complaints). The
current study (not unlike prior literature) relied on ``global'',
aggregated measures of depression, which obscure symptom-level
variations, potentially hindering the mechanistic understanding of the
dynamics involved in the relationship between depression and
cardio-metabolic health. Future studies are therefore warranted to
clarify symptom-level dynamics and confirm whether these findings are
truly independent of factors such as puberty, ethnicity, lifestyle
and/or socio-economic status.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-1}

In summary, this study addresses several important limitations of
previous research, which taken together may have hindered our
understanding of the relationship between depressive symptoms and
cardio-metabolic risk factors over the course of development. Indeed, we
show that when these constructs are measured more adequately (i.e.,
using self-reports of depressive symptoms and fat-based measures of
adiposity), their relationship appears more reciprocal than previously
thought. This is especially important in light of the increasing
prevalence of both early-onset depressive symptoms and child obesity, as
well as their substantial, enduring consequences for life-long health
and well-being.

\markright{Abstract}

\ul{Background}: Arterial wall thickness and stiffness, and high blood
pressure have been repeatedly associated with poorer brain health.
However, previous studies largely focused on mid- or late-life stages.
It is unknown whether any arterial health--related brain changes may be
observable already in adolescence.

\ul{Methods}: We examined whether \emph{(1)} carotid intima-media
thickness, \emph{(2)} carotid distensibility, and \emph{(3)} systolic
blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, measured at the age of 10
years, were associated with brain volumes and white matter
microstructure (i.e., fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) at the
age of 14 years. In addition to cross-sectional analyses, we explored
associations with longitudinal change in each brain outcome from 10 to
14 years. Analyses were based on 5341 children from the Generation R
Study.

\ul{Results}: Higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with lower
total brain volume (β {[}95\% CI{]} = −0.04 {[}−0.07; −0.01{]}) and gray
matter volume (β {[}95\% CI{]} = −0.04 {[}−0.07; −0.01{]}) at the age of
14 years, with stronger associations in higher diastolic blood pressure
ranges. Similar associations emerged between systolic blood pressure and
brain volumes, but these were no longer significant after adjusting for
birth weight. No associations were observed between blood pressure and
white matter microstructure or between carotid intima-media thickness or
distensibility and brain morphology.

\ul{Conclusions}: Arterial blood pressure, but not intima-media
thickness and distensibility, is associated with structural neuroimaging
markers in early adolescence. Volumetric measures may be more sensitive
to these early arterial health differences compared to microstructural
properties of the white matter, but further studies are needed to
confirm these results and assess potential causal mechanisms.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-5}

While cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death
worldwide, the global burden of brain disease is rapidly increasing and
is often associated with the same risk factors, as highlighted by the
latest statistical update from the American Heart Association (Tsao et
al., 2022). Indeed, known cardiovascular risk factors such as
hypertension (Alateeq et al., 2022; Beauchet et al., 2013), arterial
stiffness (Badji et al., 2019; Baradaran \& Gupta, 2020) and
atherosclerosis (Baradaran \& Gupta, 2020; Wang et al., 2022), have been
consistently associated with the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease
(e.g., stroke and white matter lesions) and cognitive decline in the
elderly.

Accumulating evidence further suggests that more subtle vascular
health--related brain changes may occur in younger adults, far before
evident injury events, and even when the overall vascular burden is low.
For example, the Framingham Third-Generation Cohort Study (FHS-G3)
investigators reported cross-sectional associations of arterial
stiffness with lower grey-matter density and white-matter
microstructural integrity, assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),
in the fifth decade of life (Maillard et al., 2016, 2017). Higher
arterial stiffness was also associated with poorer processing speed and
executive function, and with larger lateral ventricular volumes in
younger adults (30-45 years) from the FHS-G3 (Pase et al., 2016).
Moreover, in a group of 45-year-old adults from the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, higher carotid intima--media
thickness (cIMT), a subclinical marker of atherosclerosis, was
associated with reduced cerebral blood flow and with poorer cognitive
function five years later (Al Hazzouri et al., 2015; Cermakova et al.,
2020). In the same cohort, midlife hypertension (Launer et al., 2015)
and increasing blood pressure trajectories from young adulthood to
middle age (Hu et al., 2022) were associated with lower cerebral
perfusion and volumetric markers of poor white- and grey- matter health
at age 50. Blood pressure was also linearly associated with reduced
grey-matter volumes and white matter microstructural integrity at age 40
in the FHS-G3 sample (Maillard et al., 2012) and with grey matter and
white matter lesion volume before the age of 45 in the UK Biobank
(Alateeq et al., 2022).

Although analogous neuroimaging studies in children are lacking, there
is evidence linking elevated blood pressure with cognitive performance
already in childhood (Lamballais et al., 2018; Lande \& Kupferman,
2019). Further, related cardiovascular risk factors, such as adiposity
(Silva et al., 2021; Steegers et al., 2021) and diabetes (Redel et al.,
2022) have been shown to associate with brain structural changes in
children and adolescents. However, thus far very little attention has
been paid to the potential impact of vascular health on the brain during
development, despite evidence that arterial stiffening and thickening,
and blood pressure dysregulation begin very early in life (Kruger et
al., 2021; Rosner et al., 2013; Song et al., 2020). From a clinical
standpoint, characterizing these associations is a fundamental step in
the development of early intervention strategies that may prevent
abnormal brain development before irreversible structural damage occurs.

Using data from the Generation R Study, a large population-based birth
cohort, we investigated how arterial thickness and distensibility, as
well as systolic / diastolic blood pressure (SBP / DBP), measured at age
10 associate with brain morphology and microstructure extracted from MRI
scans at age 10 and 14 years.

This study was \href{https://osf.io/ryc7e}{pre-registered}. Briefly, we
hypothesized that: 1) higher cIMT, 2) lower distensibility and 3) higher
SBP / DBP would associate with \emph{a)} lower total brain volume,
\emph{b)} lower grey-matter volume, \emph{c)} lower global fractional
anisotropy and/or \emph{d)} higher mean diffusivity.

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the
corresponding author upon reasonable request.

\subsection{Study population}\label{study-population}

The study uses data from the Generation R Study, an ongoing
population-based prospective cohort study based in the city of
Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A detailed cohort description is provided
elsewhere (Kooijman et al., 2016). In summary, the cohort included 9749
children born between April 2002 and January 2006. The analytical sample
consisted of 5341 singletons who participated in the baseline (i.e.,
10-year) visit and had no siblings in the sample (see
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Figure S1}). Of these children, 2054 had
complete structural MRI data and 2308 had complete DTI data. Missing
values in all variables of interest were imputed by random-forest
multiple imputation. Ethical standards. The study conforms with the
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (2013). Written
informed consent was obtained from parents. The medical ethical
committee of Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam approved
the study.

\subsection{Arterial health}\label{arterial-health}

At the age of 10 years, carotid artery ultrasound was performed using
the Logiq E9 device (GE Medical Systems, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin) while
blood pressure was simultaneously assessed at the right brachial artery.
Children were in supine position, with their head tilted slightly away
from the transducer. The common carotid artery was identified in a
longitudinal plane, \textasciitilde10 mm proximal from the carotid
bifurcation. Each common carotid artery was measured three times,
resulting in six recordings that ideally included multiple heart cycles.

\textbf{\emph{Carotid intima--media thickness.}} For each ultrasound
recording, and at all R waves of the simultaneous electrocardiogram,
cIMT was computed at the far wall as the average distance between
lumen-intima and media-adventitia borders. Average cIMT of all frames of
the acquired image sequence was then computed. Analyses were performed
offline and semiautomatically, using the application Carotid Studio
(Cardiovascular Suite; Quipu srl, Pisa, Italy). Overall mean cIMT
(millimeters) was standardized using a z-transformation - i.e., (value
-- sample mean) / sample SD.

\textbf{\emph{Carotid distensibility.}} The c coefficient, i.e., the
relative change in lumen area during systole for a given peripheral
pressure change was calculated as the difference between the maximal
(diastolic) and minimal (systolic) lumen diameter of the carotid artery.
Lumen diameter was computed as the average distance between the far and
near media-adventitia interfaces for each frame of the acquired image
sequence. Per recording, average distension and diameter values were
used to compute the average carotid distensibility. Overall mean carotid
distensibility (kPa\textsuperscript{−1} × 10\textsuperscript{−3}) was
standardized using a z-transformation.

\textbf{\emph{Blood pressure.}} SBP and DBP were measured at the right
brachial artery, four times with 1-min intervals, using the validated
automatic sphygmomanometer Datascope Accutorr PlusTM (Paramus, New
Jersey, USA). SBP and DBP (mm Hg) were determined by excluding the first
measurement and averaging the other measurements, and were standardized
using a z-transformation.

\subsection{Brain imaging}\label{brain-imaging}

At the ages of 10 and 14 years, participants visited the Generation R
research center at Erasmus MC -- Sophia Children's Hospital, where brain
Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) were acquired using a single, dedicated
3-Tesla scanner (General Electric MR750w, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an
eight-channel head coil. To minimize head motion, participants were
familiarized with the scanner environment using a mock scanner.

\textbf{\emph{Brain volume.}} High resolution T1-weighted images were
obtained with an inversion recovery fast-spoiled gradient recalled
sequence (parameters: TR = 8.77 ms, TE = 3.4 ms, TI = 600 ms, flip angle
= 10°, FOV = 220×220mm, acquisition matrix = 220×220, slice thickness =
1mm, number of slices = 230, voxel size = 1×1×1mm, ARC
Acceleration = 2). Images were processed using FreeSurfer 6.0 (Fischl,
2012). The technical details of these procedures are described elsewhere
(Muetzel et al., 2019). In brief, this included removal of the non-brain
tissue, segmentation of white and grey matter structures, tessellation
of the grey-white matter boundary, topology correction and surface
deformation to identify the cortical grey-white matter and the
grey-cerebrospinal fluid boundary. Reconstructions were visually
inspected and those with insufficient quality were further excluded
(Muetzel et al., 2019).

Global metrics of volume, i.e., total brain (TBV) and total grey matter
volume (GMV), as well as specific subcortical structures' volumes were
extracted. Brain metrics were be standardized using a z-transformation.

\textbf{\emph{White matter microstructure.}} DTI data were obtained
using an echo-planar sequence with three b = 0 scans and 35
diffusion-weighted images (b = 1000 s/mm\textsuperscript{2}). The
following parameters were used: TR = 12.5 ms, TE = 72.8 ms, FOV =
240×240 mm, acquisition matrix = 120×120, slice thickness = 2 mm, number
of slices = 65. Images were pre-processed using
\href{https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/}{FSL 6.0.1}. Briefly, non-brain
tissue was removed, images were corrected for eddy current-induced
distortions and minor head motion using `eddy', and the diffusion
gradient table was rotated accordingly. A diffusion tensor was fit at
each voxel using a weighted least squares method, and common scalar
metrics including global fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
(MD) were computed. FA describes the degree to which water diffuses
preferentially along one direction (e.g., along a bundle of myelinated
axons) and is sensitive to microstructural changes. MD describes the
average diffusion in all directions. White matter tracts, were also
delineated using fully-automated probabilistic fiber tractography as
implemented in FSL AutoPtx (De Groot et al., 2013). Average FA and MD
were calculated for each tract. Global and tract-specific FA and MD
values were standardized using a z-transformation. Image quality was
assessed by manual and automated inspection (Muetzel et al., 2018).

\subsection{Covariates}\label{covariates-1}

Information on the maternal age and child ethnic background (based on
parental country of origin and dichotomized into European
vs.~non-European) was collected by questionnaire at enrollment. Date of
birth and child sex, weight and gestational age were recorded at birth.
Both caregivers reported on their highest completed educational level
when children were 6 years old, and these reports were combined into a
single ``parental education'' score. Child height (in m) and weight (in
kg) were measured during the 10-years visit, and used to compute body
mass index (BMI) z-scores.

\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis-2}

Analyses were conducted using R version 4.2.0(R Core Team, 2021). All
scripts are
\href{https://github.com/SereDef/arterial-health-brain}{publicly
available}.

\textbf{\emph{Imputation.}} Missing data in all exposures, outcomes and
covariates were imputed by random-forest multiple imputation (Shah et
al., 2014), using 20 imputed datasets, 10 trees and 40 iterations, as
implemented by the mice R package (Buuren \& Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011).
Details of the imputation model and quality are provided in
Supplementary materials (\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Methods S1} and
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S1}).

\textbf{\emph{Main analyses.}} All models were fit in each imputed
dataset, and pooled across imputations using Rubin's rules (Rubin,
1987). For each exposure of interest (i.e., carotid IMT and
distensibility, SBP and DBP), four multiple linear regressions were
performed including \emph{a)} TBV, \emph{b)} GMV, \emph{c)} global FA
and \emph{d)} global MD, measured at age 14, as dependent variable. We
ran a ``base model'' adjusting for child sex, height, age at MRI
assessment and age gap between clinical and MRI assessments, and a
``confounder model'', which additionally included child ethnicity, BMI
z-score, parental education and maternal age. Covariates were identified
based on the graphical criteria for confounding
(\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Figure S2}).

To minimize false positive findings due to multiple testing (k=16),
false discovery rate (FDR) correction (Benjamini \& Yekutieli, 2001) was
applied to all p-values.

Non-linear terms for each arterial health exposure (i.e., natural
splines) were retained in the model when they significantly improved its
fit (see \href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Methods S2}).

\textbf{\emph{Exploratory follow-up analyses.}} We further assessed
associations between each exposure and the longitudinal change in each
neuroimaging marker from age 10 to 14 years, using linear mixed-effects
models with a random intercept per subject (see
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Methods S3}; (Bates et al., 2015)). Note
that brain outcomes were not standardized for these analyses to prevent
incorrect estimation of the correlation structure.

To further characterize the regional specificity of these effects, we
assessed associations with: total intracranial, cerebro-spinal fluid,
white matter, cortical and subcortical grey matter volumes, as well as
subcortical regional volumes (Accumbens, Amygdala, Caudate, Hippocampus,
Pallidum, Putamen, Thalamus); white-matter tracts FA and MD (Cingulate
gyrus, Cortico-spinal tract, Uncinate fasciculus, Inferior \& Superior
longitudinal fasciculus, Major \& Minor forceps), and vertex-wise
cortical thickness (see \href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Methods S4}) at age
14. These latter analyses were further adjusted for total intracranial
volume.

Finally, since sex differences and premature birth have been implicated
in the associations of interest (Gluckman et al., 2008; Pasha et al.,
2018), we \emph{a)} investigated effect modification by sex and
\emph{b)} additionally adjusted the main models for birthweight and
gestational age at birth.

\textbf{\emph{Sensitivity analyses.}} To assess the impact and adequacy
of our sample selection and imputation procedure, we ran all analyses in
the full cohort (\emph{n}=9749) and in the subsample with complete
outcome data (\emph{n}=2054-2308).

\subsection{Main analyses}\label{main-analyses-3}

An overview of the main results is presented in Figure~\ref{fig-7.1}.
Complete model outputs are reported in supplementary materials
(\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S3}). Neither carotid IMT nor
distensibility were significantly associated with any brain outcome
(Figure~\ref{fig-7.1} A-B, \href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S3}). After
adjustment for potential confounders, SBP was (cross-sectionally)
associated with lower TBV (β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.04 {[}-0.07;-0.01{]},
P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .030) and GMV (β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.05
{[}-0.08;-0.01{]}, P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .030) but not with
either FA or MD (Figure~\ref{fig-7.1} C,
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S3}). Analogously, DBP was
(cross-sectionally) associated with TBV (β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.04
{[}-0.07;-0.01{]}, P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .022) and GMV (β
{[}95\%CI{]} = -0.04 {[}-0.07;-0.01{]}, P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} =
.022), but not FA or MD (Figure~\ref{fig-7.1} D,

We found evidence of a non-linear relationship between SBP and white

brain volumes (P=.012 for TBV; P=.006 for GMV). However, these
departures from linearity were small, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-7.2}

\subsection{Exploratory follow-up
analyses}\label{exploratory-follow-up-analyses}

In our exploratory longitudinal models, we did not find any significant
interaction between arterial health markers and age at MRI measurement
(\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S4}; Figure 3). However, when
interaction terms were excluded from the models, we could further
confirm a negative main effect of SBP and DBP on total brain and grey
matter volumes measured at 10 and 14 years
(\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S5}). Specifically, while TBV
increased with age (\emph{b} {[}95\%CI{]} = 7.0 {[}6.4; 7.7{]}
cm\textsuperscript{3} per year) each SD increase in SBP was associated
with -3.6 {[}-6.4; -0.8{]} cm\textsuperscript{3}
(P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} =.048) and each SD increase in DBP was
associated with -3.4 {[}-6.1; -0.7{]} cm\textsuperscript{3}
(P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} =.040) TBV. Conversely, GMV showed a slight
decline over our age range (\emph{b} {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.6 {[}-1.0;
-0.2{]} cm\textsuperscript{3} per year) while each SD increase in SBP
was associated with -2.4 {[}-4.1; -0.7{]} cm\textsuperscript{3}
(P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} =.042) and each SD increase in DBP was
associated with -2.2 {[}-3.8; -0.6{]} cm\textsuperscript{3}
(P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} =.039) GMV.

Associations were largely homogenous between sexes
(\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Figure S4},
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S6}) and did not seem to be explained
by differences in cranium size, nor by a significant increase in
cerebro-spinal fluid volumes (\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Figure S5},
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S7}). There were no significant
associations between either exposure and total or region-specific
subcortical volumes (\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Figure S5},
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S8}) nor with white matter tracts FA
and MD (\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Figures S6-S7},
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Tables S9-S10}). SBP was significantly
associated with total cortical volume (β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.05
{[}-0.08;-0.01{]}, P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .036; see
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Figure S5} and
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S7}), but no local associations with
cortical thickness emerged from the vertex-wise analyses
(\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S11}).

Notably, the associations between SBP and total/grey matter volumes were
significantly attenuated after adjusting for birth-related covariates
(TBV: β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.03 {[}-0.06; 0.01{]},
P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .230; GMV: β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.03
{[}-0.06; 0.00{]}, P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .229; see
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Table S12}).

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses-1}

Restricting the analyses to participants with complete outcome data
(\emph{n} = 2054 for structural MRI and 2308 for DTI) did not
substantively change the reported findings, besides a slight increase in
effect sizes for both SBP (TBV: β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.05
{[}-0.09;-0.01{]}, P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .016; GMV: β
{[}95\%CI{]} = -0.06 {[}-0.09;-0.02{]}, P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} =
.013) and DBP (TBV and GMV: β {[}95\%CI{]} = -0.05 {[}-0.09;-0.02{]},
P\textsubscript{\emph{FDR}} = .012; see
\href{https://osf.io/2f4sg}{Tables S13-S14}).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-5}

In this population-based prospective cohort study, we observed that
systolic and diastolic blood pressure at age 10 years were associated
with lower total and grey matter volumes at age 10 and 14 years. The
associations between systolic blood pressure and brain volumes were
partially explained by birth-related confounders (particularly
birthweight). No significant associations were observed for carotid
intima-media thickness or distensibility, nor for white matter
microstructural markers.

\subsection{Interpretation of main
findings}\label{interpretation-of-main-findings}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a
link between high blood pressure and brain volume reduction in the
general pediatric population. Together with previous pediatric
neuroimaging studies focusing mainly on adiposity (Brain Development
Cooperative Group, 2012; Silva et al., 2021; Steegers et al., 2021), our
findings confirm the idea that, already at school age and within
subclinical ranges, an adverse cardiovascular profile may negatively
impact brain development.

We could not find evidence for a significant role of arterial wall
thickness or stiffness on the adolescent brain, as we had expected based
on adult reports (Cermakova et al., 2020; Maillard et al., 2016). This
might have been due to insufficient sensitivity of ultrasound measures
and/or lack of variability in these markers in healthy pediatric
population.

In line with our findings, several previous studies reported a negative
association between (diastolic) blood pressure and cognitive function in
children and adolescents (Dawson et al., 2021; Lamballais et al., 2018;
Lande \& Kupferman, 2019; Lucas et al., 2022). The biological substrate
underlying these associations, however, is less studied. Interestingly,
a few transcranial Doppler ultrasound studies demonstrated blunted
cerebrovascular reactivity in hypertensive children (Lande \& Kupferman,
2019; Wong et al., 2011), however, these were conducted in small samples
and suffer from wide inter-observer measurement variability. We
corroborated and extended these findings using more stable structural
MRI markers, and found that morphological brain outcomes (volumetric
measures) may be already sensitive to early increase in arterial blood
pressure. This was not true for microstructural properties of the white
matter, which was unexpected, as adult studies typically point to
impaired white matter integrity as an early marker of neurovascular
pathology (Maillard et al., 2012). However, it is important to note that
both macroscopic and microstructural changes reported in older
populations may reflect different processes (e.g., cellular atrophy and
white matter lesions) compared to earlier developmental windows, where
the same neuroimaging markers may underlie, for instance, grey and white
matter maturation. Indeed, while grey matter maturation tends to peak
already in early adolescence, white matter growth typically doesn't peak
until mid-adulthood, which could partly explain the observed pattern of
results (Groeschel et al., 2010).

\subsection{Biological mechanisms}\label{biological-mechanisms}

Several potential mechanisms could explain the reported associations.
For example, it was been proposed that high blood pressure could cause
damage to the neurovasculature and result in reduced cerebral blood
perfusion, leading to suboptimal oxygen and nutritional supplies, and
potentially altering ongoing neurodevelopmental processes (Lucas et al.,
2022). Additionally, alterations in immune and
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning resulting from
chronically high blood pressure could trigger neuroinflammation, further
impairing brain development (Perrotta et al., 2018).

\subsection{Clinical relevance}\label{clinical-relevance}

Over the past decades, the prevalence of high blood pressure among
children and adolescents has increased dramatically, in concert with the
global epidemic of obesity (Riley et al., 2018). Elevated blood pressure
in childhood is known to track into adulthood and increase the risk of
cardiovascular disease (Yang et al., 2020). In our 10-year-old sample,
each 6 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure (i.e., 1 SD) was
followed by a 3.6 cm\textsuperscript{3} reduction in total brain volume,
and a 2.3 cm\textsuperscript{3} reduction in grey matter volume four
years later. In our longitudinal follow-up analysis, we could further
show how this corresponded to about one third of the estimated yearly
change in TBV. These results are important from a developmental
perspective, since they suggest that early detection and prevention of
elevated blood pressure may be relevant not only for long-term
cardiovascular health but also for structural brain development.
However, whether these associations are clinically relevant (e.g., in
terms of cognitive performance or mental health symptomatology) or
whether they will evolve into long-term alteration of brain health,
needs to be further studied. Nevertheless, pediatric screening for high
blood pressure may be a relatively easy measure to implement to monitor
and potentially decrease the risk of future brain disease and cognitive
impairment.

\subsection{Strengths and limitations}\label{strengths-and-limitations}

This study used prospectively measured data from a large
population-based sample. Detailed and objective measures of both
arterial and brain health were available and selection bias due to
non-response was addressed thoroughly using multiple imputation and
sensitivity analyses. However, it is important to note that, although we
adjusted the analyses for several socio-demographic and lifestyle
factors known to influence the associations, residual confounding, for
example by genetic predisposition, exposure to stress, nutritional
intake or physical activity, may still be present. Additionally, note
that, for practical reasons, blood pressure was measured in supine
position in this study, as opposed to more conventional sitting
measures. Further studies are undoubtedly needed to replicate and
validate these findings, and to further investigate potential underlying
mechanisms and/or modifiable factors that could explain or attenuate
these associations.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-2}

High blood pressure in childhood was associated with suboptimal brain
development already in early adolescence, particularly with respect to
reduced total brain and grey matter volumes. Pediatric screening for
high blood pressure may thus be relevant not only for the prevention of
long-term cardiovascular health problems, but also for structural brain
development. Identifying such early biomarkers of neurovascular health
entails important implications for future clinical and public heath
priorities, especially considering the established relationship between
these markers and later prognosis of cerebrovascular disease and
dementia.

\chapter{General discussion}\label{general-discussion}

In this dissertation we \ldots{}

We focus on adolescence, a critical developmental period, when many
mental health problems first emerge, and early signs of cardio-metabolic
dysregulation begin to manifest. By examining these relationships
prospectively, this thesis' goal was to provide a clearer understanding
of \textbf{(a)} how ELS impacts psycho-physical health and \textbf{(b)}
how mental and physical health influence each other, during this
critical, formative stage of life.

Some \textbf{key findings} / insights we gathered across this thesis:

Part I: - (Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter2}) - (Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter3}) -
(Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter4}) - (Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter5})

Part II:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is a reciprocal, prospective association between depressive
  symptoms and adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass index, but not body mass
  index) from age 10 to 25 years; In addition to these within-person
  associations (which are directional and time-specific) there are
  stable between-person associations (likely reflecting the contribution
  of ``time-invariant'' shared risk factors) between depressive symptoms
  and adiposity (Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter6})
\item
  Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure (but Intima-media thickness or
  arterial distensibility) at age 10 years were associated with lower
  total and grey matter volumes already before 15 years of age
  (Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter7})
\end{itemize}

From a clinical standpoint, characterizing these associations is a
fundamental step in the development of early intervention strategies
that may prevent mental and physical health problems before the onset of
more severe symptoms and irreversible structural changes (e.g.~to the
brain, the heart or the arteries).

Now, I started this book with a confession: I absolutely hated writing
this thesis, down to almost every paragraph. But, because you made it
this far - or anyway you happened to open the book on this doomed last
chapter - you won the dubious reward of getting to know why. Here is a
collection of things I would have done differently, followed by a few
things I wish we all did differently.

\section{\texorpdfstring{What we \emph{measure} and what we
\emph{mean}}{What we measure and what we mean}}\label{what-we-measure-and-what-we-mean}

If you want to know whether something in true, you'll need evidence. To
get evidence you'll need data. Before you can start collecting data, you
need to know how to measure. A fundamental step in human research (one
that often goes wrong) is translating what we \emph{mean} into a
quantity to measure.

\subsection{Modelling ELS}\label{modelling-els}

In this dissertation, we use a cumulative risk approach. We define
``stressors'' dichotomously (i.e., ``it happened'' vs.~``It didn't
happen'') and then we sum across these multiple dichotomous indicators
to obtain someone's ``stress exposure''. Let's stress then the first
important aspect of using this measure: we examine the \emph{number of
stressors} experienced, rather than the \emph{intensity} or the
\emph{pattern} of stress exposure.

This comes with several covenient advantages and as many drawbacks.

\subsubsection{Cumulative risk}\label{cumulative-risk}

Cumulative risk scores are a straightforward way of identifying children
at increased odds for developing a range of maladaptive outcomes. They
are popular across fields -- genetics parallel. They are a simple way to
inject some order into a very complex world.

The fundamental problem is that different sources of stress have
different statistical properties. For example, some stressors are
(largely) independent from one another (e.g., sickness and burglary),
some may be mutually exclusive (e.g.~death of a parent and divorce),
others overlap (e.g., material deprivation and overcrowding). For
example, many low-income families live in substardard housing, located
in high crime neighborhoods; their children may attend schools with
inadequate facilities, staffed by less experienced teachers; and many
live in single parent households.

Combining multiple stress exposures in one single composite score is one
way to capture this complexity. This technique has been argues to
enhance prediction in several ways. For example, by reducing measurement
error, enhancing validity (because no one single measure adequately
captures the meaning and the variance of the construct of interest).
Cumulative scores also avoid the issue of collinear predictors in the
same general linear model, which may lead to unstable estimates and
diminish statistical power.

Indeed, picking a single stressor, say noise exposure, without taking
into account overlapping risk factors could overestimate the harmful
impacts of that predictor. On the other hand noise by itself may have
negligible impact except when accompanied by household disadvantage. In
the latter case, by isolating the singular impact of noise exposure we
might erroneously conclude that noise does not matter. Another way to
think about this is that perhaps there is no \emph{main effect} of noise
but an interaction or moderator effect.Noise matters but only in the
presence of certain other variables.

No free lunch: It does not take into account interaction between the
individual stressors. The use interactive, nonadditive model of multiple
risks is often not possible when a large number of risk factors are
under consideration. Using additive models is a common approach for
dealing with this dilemma.

But is there a ``better'' way?

\subsubsection{Stress ``patterns''}\label{stress-patterns}

\subsubsection{missing pieces: resilience and stress
intensity}\label{missing-pieces-resilience-and-stress-intensity}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  difficult to measure
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parental reports}\label{parental-reports}

Like most studies in the literature, information about childhood (and
gestational) stress exposure was obtained by asking their parents. This
is obviously a major limitation in this field of research. At best,
these reports are likely to reflect a combination of parents' own stress
experiences, psychological state, and personality\ldots{}

\subsection{Modelling (adolescent) mental
health}\label{modelling-adolescent-mental-health}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  are we asking the right people? parental reports
\item
  are we asking the right questions (probably not)? --\textgreater{} old
  data: old insights
\item
  the ``implicit'' causal model of cumulative mental health scores
\item
  alterative approaches: network analysis
\end{itemize}

How do we measure mental health? Badly In this thesis, we relied on
standardized questionnaires, such as the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ), which provide a composite score of emotional and
behavioral difficulties. While these tools are widely used and
validated, they are not without limitations. Self-reports and
parent-reports are subject to biases, including social desirability and
recall bias. Furthermore, these measures often fail to capture the
dynamic and context-dependent nature of mental health, which can
fluctuate over time and across environments.

Future research should aim to integrate multi-method approaches,
combining self-reports, observational data, and physiological markers,
to provide a more comprehensive assessment of mental health.

Note: Other measures of adolescent behaviour, e.g., externalizing
problems, could represent interesting targets for future studies in the
field\ldots.

\subsection{Modelling (adolescent) cardio-metabolic
risk}\label{modelling-adolescent-cardio-metabolic-risk}

Measuring mental health is an inherently hard task: it requires coming
up with a tangible (or better, measurable) quantity to stand in for an
abstract, multifaceted and frustratingly complex construct. You would
think the job is considerably easier when the object of study is
something like adiposity, which enjoys a much longer, solid tradition of
objective measurement and clinical usefulness. Well, let's talk about
that.

\subsubsection{BMI}\label{bmi}

In this thesis, we made out best effort to stir away from BMI when we
measured adiposity and here is a few thoughts on why i'd defend this
choice.

The concept of BMI was introduced in 1835 by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian
astronomer. Quetelet became increasing interested in defining the
characteristics of the ``average man'' (l'\emph{homme moyen}, to use his
words)\ldots{} among French and Scottish conscripts. (a concept than was
about to become very popular among Eugenics enthusiasts)

BMI has since become a widely used tool in public health and clinical
settings, although it was never intended to be a diagnostic measure of
individual health or adiposity. Its simplicity and ease of use have
contributed to its popularity, so much so that, today, virtually
everyone has heard of BMI.

but it has significant limitations, particularly in distinguishing
between muscle and fat mass, and in accounting for variations in body
composition across different populations.

\subsubsection{CRP}\label{crp}

\subsection{Modelling comorbidity}\label{modelling-comorbidity}

``Together with previous pediatric neuroimaging studies focusing mainly
on adiposity (Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2012; Silva et al.,
2021; Steegers et al., 2021), our findings confirm the idea that,
already at school age and within subclinical ranges, an adverse
cardiovascular profile may negatively impact brain development.''

Additionally, alterations in immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis functioning resulting from chronically high blood pressure could
trigger neuroinflammation, further impairing brain development

\end{itemize}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Causal\emph{-ish}
inferences}{Causal-ish inferences}}\label{causal-ish-inferences}

In the four chapters enclosed in Part I of this thesis, I have tried to
map the influence of ELS on physical and mental health, including some
biomarkers. Part II then focused on the reciprocal influence between
physical and mental health conditions. I say ``influence'' with
cognition, mind you. I saw you raising your eyebrow. \emph{``Causal
wording, rephrase''} is among the most common co-author comments I've
seen across the years, which should have surprised me after 3 university
degrees, in three different fields, all dominated by the same mantra:
``correlation is not causation''.

\subsubsection{``good'' and ``bad'' causal
variables}\label{good-and-bad-causal-variables}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
\item
  good causes but bad predictors (I don't think so)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Where (the hell) is
\textbf{time}?}{Where (the hell) is time?}}\label{where-the-hell-is-time}

Do bike accidents cause bruises?

\subsubsection{Measurement error and information
bias}\label{measurement-error-and-information-bias}

Our measurement of ELS, of the lifestyle behaviours and of internalizing
/ depressive symptoms rely primarily on parent reports, which might have
introduced information bias.

Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter6} also shows these are not necessarily good
proxies compared to self reports\ldots{}

\subsubsection{Selection bias}\label{selection-bias}

Let's talk about something we did do right (I think)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  lifestyle interventions based on observational studies?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{unethical} causal
models}{unethical causal models}}\label{unethical-causal-models}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  socio-economic status as a confounder
\item
  ethnicity
\end{itemize}

In some chapters, ethnicity was reduces to ``White'' vs.~``non-White''
(most often becasue of limitaiton of the data), however this is a major
limitation.

\section{Science is dead (and we have killed
it)}\label{science-is-dead-and-we-have-killed-it}

Before I let you go, dear reader, there is one more thing I need to get
off my chest, if you'll let me. I began this book with a confession:
writing this was so much harder then I expected, and in all honesty this
is a big part of why.

\subsection{This is grim, I mean really
grim}\label{this-is-grim-i-mean-really-grim}

Studies with null findings are less likely to be published than those
with statistically significant results.

\subsubsection{code is the scientific product, the paper is just
advertisement}\label{code-is-the-scientific-product-the-paper-is-just-advertisement}

\subsection{On the professionalization of
science}\label{on-the-professionalization-of-science}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  git
\item
  testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{On the uselessness of
journals}\label{on-the-uselessness-of-journals}

Journals should not gatekeep knowledge.

The academic publishing dream: You do the research - You write the paper
- You review someone else's paper (for free) - Then you pay to publish
your own - And your university pays again so others can read it.
Meanwhile, publishers sit back and make hugh profits --- built on public
funding, unpaid labor, and a prestige system they didn't create but
fully exploit.

And we keep playing along

Maybe it's time we stop pretending this is normal. There are
alternatives. Fair, open, non-profit models exist --- run by researchers
for researchers. Think community-owned journals, preprints, and
platforms that don't turn scientific knowledge into a paywall business.
We don't need to burn down the system --- we just need to stop feeding
it.

It is about time academics and academic leaders learn the craft of
negotiating. Had they had it, things might have ended differently and
they (and the tax payer) would not have been exploited in this
ridiculous way. Perhaps it is not too late yet: get organised and
bargain. Publishers are not invincible! If there is such a sincere
agreement in academic community that the current model is not
sustainable, then where are lawsuits?

And why such lawsuits are not brought up by national-level funding
watchdogs, as after all it is mostly public funding that's being
extracted via scientific publication process to\ldots{} where?

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-3}

Children starve and I still write bs

\subsection{So what was this all for?}\label{so-what-was-this-all-for}

So what was this all for? Excellent question. Kept me up a few nights I
argued prevention of comorbidity was key, but am I actually any closer,
even purely theoretically to a useful insight?

\subsection{Preventing ELS}\label{preventing-els}

In Chapter~\ref{sec-chapter3} you can find me saying: \emph{``While
these findings certainly support the importance of primary prevention
programmes aimed at reducing the incidence of ELS, preventing ELS may
not always be possible. As such, there is a need to identify alternative
modifiable factors that could mitigate the negative impact of ELS on
later health, and inform the development of complementary intervention
strategies.''}

\subsubsection{SES}\label{ses}

What seems to emerge from the studies is that the key factor across
physical and mental health was the contextual risk component of the ELS
score. Let's unpack that. The key stress indicators within contextual
risk are low parental education, financial and neighborhood problems.
These are constructs commonly referred to as low socio-economic status
(SES).

\subsubsection{Lifestyle}\label{lifestyle}

In the same chapter I did not find evidence of such promising
``modifiable factors''. Based on data from two independent
population-based cohorts, either physical activity, sleep or dietary
behaviour did not attenuate the association between ELS exposure and
adolescent psycho-physical comorbidity. That was surprising to me, but
also, as I later came to find out not so rare in the research on
lifestyle factors.

``Developmental timing and / or differences in outcome measurement may
have played a role in explaining this discrepancy. It is possible, for
example, that engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviours later in life may
be more beneficial, or that the protective effects of childhood
lifestyle behaviours may manifest only later in adulthood. It is also
possible that the associations reported in the adult literature may be
biased through reverse causation (e.g., depression being a causal risk
factor for poor diet and sleep; (Choi et al., 2020).'' ``differential
measurement error could have played a role in explaining this finding.
Indeed, our ELS measure was considerably more comprehensive (i.e.,
comprised of many more items and covering a longer time period) compared
to each of the lifestyle factors, which were only assessed at a single
time point and based on fewer indicators. It is possible, for example,
that the hypothesized moderation effects may emerge when a more
long-term engagement in physical activity is considered.''
