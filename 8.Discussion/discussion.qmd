In this dissertation ...
We focus on adolescence, a critical developmental period, when many mental health problems first emerge, and early signs of cardio-metabolic dysregulation begin to manifest. By examining these relationships prospectively, this thesis seeks to provide a clearer understanding of how ELS impacts psycho-physical health during this formative stage of life.

I started this book with a confession: I hated writing this. Since you meade it this far (or anyway happened to open this doomed chapter), you won the dubious reward of knowing why. Here is a collection of thing I would have done differently, followed by a few things I wish we all did differently.  

## Modelling ELS

### Parental reports 
Like most previous literatures, childrenâ€™s stress exposure information was obtained via parental report and thus likely reflect a combination of parents' own stress experiences, psychological state, and personality. 

### Missing piece: resilience 

### Information bias? 
Our measurement of ELS, lifestyle behaviours and internalizing symptoms rely primarily on parent reports, which might have introduced information bias. does that generalise to self reports? 
Other measures of adolescent behaviour, e.g., externalizing problems, could represent interesting targets for future studies in the field.


## Alternative modelling methods 
A cumulative risk approach examines the number of stressors experienced rather than the intensity or the pattern of stress exposure. We define stressors dichotomously and then sum across multiple dichotomous exposures. 
As an additive model, this technique is a straightforward, way of identifying children at increased odds for developing a range of maladaptive outcomes, including
cognitive deficits, behavioral adjustment problems, and poor physical health.

Multiple stressors exposures can sometimes overlap (e.g., harsh and unresponsive parenting) or be independent (e.g., life events), but in each case prediction is enhanced by combining multiple risks in the model.
Multiple stressors exposures can sometimes overlap (e.g., material deprivation and overcrowding) or be independent (e.g., death of a parent and overcrowding), but in each case prediction is enhanced by combining multiple risks in the model. There are several advantages of formulating indices of multiple stress exposures into a composite score. Measurement error is reduced, validity is enhanced because no one singular measure adequately captures the full meaning of the construct of interest, avoids the issue of collinear predictors in the same general linear model, which may lead to unstable estimates and diminish statistical power.
For example, many low-income families live in substardard housing, located in high crime neighborhoods; their children may attend schools with inadequate facilities, staffed by less experienced teachers; and many live in single parent households.

it does not take into account interaction between the individual stressors
Singling out the effects of school
noise exposure on reading quality without taking into account
these overlapping risk factors for reading deficits could overestimate the harmful impacts of noise on reading deficits. On the other
hand, noise by itself may have negligible impact on reading
deficits except when accompanied by household disadvantage or
only if the exposure happens within the context of a school with
inadequate facilities and staff. In the latter case, by isolating the
singular impact of noise exposure as a risk factor for reading
deficits, we might erroneously conclude that noise does not matter.
It may in fact be a contributing risk factor for reading deficits but
only when considered within the natural ecological context
wherein high noise schools typically operate. Another way to think
about this is that perhaps there is no main effect of noise on
reading deficits but an interaction or moderator effect. Noise
matters but only in the presence of certain other variables. As
we explain below however, the use of an interactive, nonadditive
model of multiple risk exposure is often not possible when a large
number of risk factors are under consideration. Use of additive
models of multiple risk factors is a common approach for dealing
with this dilemma.

## Modelling comorbidity 

### old data, old insights: mental health
How do we measure mental health? Badly
In this thesis, we relied on standardized questionnaires, such as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which provide a composite score of emotional and behavioral difficulties. While these tools are widely used and validated, they are not without limitations. Self-reports and parent-reports are subject to biases, including social desirability and recall bias. Furthermore, these measures often fail to capture the dynamic and context-dependent nature of mental health, which can fluctuate over time and across environments. 

Future research should aim to integrate multi-method approaches, combining self-reports, observational data, and physiological markers, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of mental health.

### old data, old insights: BMI
Measuring mental health is an inherently hard task: it requires coming up with a tangible (or better, measurable) quantity to stand in for an abstract, multifaceted and frustratingly complex construct. You would  think the job is considerably easier when the object of study is something like adiposity, which enjoys a much longer, solid tradition of objective measurement and clinical usefulness. Well, let's talk about BMI. 

In this thesis, we made out best effort to stir away from BMI when we measured adiposity and here is a few thoughts on why i'd defend this choice.

The concept of BMI was introduced in 1835 by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer. Quetelet became increasing interested in defining the characteristics of the "average man" (l'*homme moyen*, to use his words)... among French and Scottish conscripts. (a concept than was about to become very popular among Eugenics enthusiasts)

BMI has since become a widely used tool in public health and clinical settings, although it was never intended to be a diagnostic measure of individual health or adiposity. Its simplicity and ease of use have contributed to its popularity, so much so that, today, virtually everyone has heard of BMI. 

but it has significant limitations, particularly in distinguishing between muscle and fat mass, and in accounting for variations in body composition across different populations.

### Alternative modelling methods

#### the role of lifestyle and puberty 
"while we focused here on three lifestyle markers that are most relevant to the developmental period of interest and may constitute important targets for early prevention, other potentially relevant factors such as smoking, alcohol use or psychological coping strategies, are also likely to be of relevance [@Hanlon2020; @Skou2022] and should be taken into account in future studies."

## So what was this all for? 
So what was this all for? Excellent question. Kept me up a few nights
I argued prevention of comorbidity was key, but am I actually any closer, even purely theoretically to a useful insight? 

### Preventing ELS
In @sec-chapter3 you can find me saying: *"While these findings certainly support the importance of primary prevention programmes aimed at reducing the incidence of ELS, preventing ELS may not always be possible. As such, there is a need to identify alternative modifiable factors that could mitigate the negative impact of ELS on later health, and inform the development of complementary intervention strategies."* 

#### Lifestyle
In the same chapter I did not find evidence of such promising "modifiable factors". Based on data from two independent population-based cohorts, either physical activity, sleep or dietary behaviour did not attenuate the association between ELS exposure and adolescent psycho-physical comorbidity. That was surprising to me, but also, as I later came to find out not so rare in the research on lifestyle factors. 
"Developmental timing and / or differences in outcome measurement may have played a role in explaining this discrepancy. It is possible, for example, that engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviours later in life may be more beneficial, or that the protective effects of childhood lifestyle behaviours may manifest only later in adulthood. It is also possible that the associations reported in the adult literature may be biased through reverse causation (e.g., depression being a causal risk factor for poor diet and sleep; (Choi et al., 2020)." "differential measurement error could have played a role in explaining this finding. Indeed, our ELS measure was considerably more comprehensive (i.e., comprised of many more items and covering a longer time period) compared to each of the lifestyle factors, which were only assessed at a single time point and based on fewer indicators. It is possible, for example, that the hypothesized moderation effects may emerge when a more long-term engagement in physical activity is considered."

#### SES 
What seems to emerge from the studies is that the key factor across physical and mental health was the contextual risk component of the ELS score. Let's unpack that. The key stress indicators within contextual risk are low parental education, financial and neighborhood problems. These are constructs commonly referred to as low socio-economic status (SES). 

## Ethnicity 
In some chapters, ethnicity was reduces to "White" vs. "non-White" (most often becasue of limitaiton of the data), however this is a major limitation. 

## Science is dead, and we killed it 
Before I let you go, dear reader, there is one more thing I need to get off my chest, if you'll let me. I began this book with a confession: writing this was so much harder then I expected, and in all honesty this is a big part of why. 
potential publication bias may limit the generalizability of
our conclusions. Studies with null findings are less likely to be
published than those with statistically significant results.
